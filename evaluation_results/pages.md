### Section Name: Workup
The workup section outlines the initial steps for diagnosing glottic larynx cancer. It includes a comprehensive history and physical examination (H&P), which should document tobacco and alcohol use, and provide counseling for smoking cessation. A biopsy of the primary site is required, and direct laryngoscopy under anesthesia is generally recommended. Imaging studies such as CT scans with contrast and possibly MRI are used to evaluate the larynx and neck. Additional evaluations may include chest CT, FDG-PET/CT, pulmonary function tests, dental evaluation, and nutrition, speech, and swallowing therapy. Multidisciplinary consultation is advised as clinically indicated.

### Section Name: Clinical Staging
Clinical staging involves categorizing the cancer based on its aggressiveness. It starts with carcinoma in situ, which is non-invasive, and progresses through stages T1-T4. Staging is based on H&P, biopsy, and imaging studies. For T1-T2, larynx-preserving surgeries are considered, while more advanced stages like T3 or T4 may require total laryngectomy. Additional evaluations such as videostrobe, audiogram, and fertility counseling may be considered.

### Section Name: Treatment
Treatment recommendations vary by stage. Carcinoma in situ may be treated with larynx-preserving surgery. T1-T2 stages may also be amenable to conservation surgery. T3 stages may require total laryngectomy, especially if nodal involvement is present. T4a disease and unresectable or metastatic cases require more complex interventions. The guidelines emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary consultations and consider clinical trials as the best management option.

### Section Name: Additional Notes
Additional notes include the use of image-guided needle biopsy for better diagnostic yield, principles of imaging, dental evaluation, and nutrition management. The guidelines also address fertility and reproductive considerations, and note that nodal disease in glottic tumors is rare.

### Section Name: Clinical Staging
**Clinical Staging**: The flowchart begins with “Carcinoma in situ” and progresses to determine the amenability of the patient to larynx-preserving surgery, specifically for tumors classified as T1 to T2, N0, or select T3, N0. This initial assessment is critical as it drives treatment decisions. In SOURCE2, it is noted that nodal disease in such glottic tumors is rare.

### Section Name: Treatment of Primary and Neck
**Treatment of Primary and Neck**: If the condition allows for larynx-preserving options, the preferred treatment is endoscopic resection or radiation therapy (RT). Alternative options include partial laryngectomy or a more extensive endoscopic/open resection with neck dissection, depending on the specific characteristics of the tumor. SOURCE2 specifies that endoscopic resection is preferred, and RT or partial laryngectomy/endoscopic or open resection is indicated as needed.

### Section Name: Adjuvant Treatment
**Adjuvant Treatment**: Following surgical intervention, the presence of adverse pathologic features (such as extranodal extension or positive margins) necessitates different adjuvant strategies. For cases without adverse features, the protocol may involve simple observation, while those exhibiting high-risk characteristics may require systemic therapy or additional radiation. SOURCE2 lists adverse pathologic features including extranodal extension, positive margins, and other risk features.

### Section Name: Follow-Up
**Follow-Up**: The flowchart concludes with follow-up strategies which are essential for monitoring recurrence or persistent disease. This part of the chart emphasizes the importance of continual assessment post-treatment to ensure any signs of recurrence are addressed promptly. SOURCE2 mentions observation, systemic therapy/RT, re-resection if feasible, and follow-up for recurrent or persistent disease.

### Section Name: Overview of Radiation Therapy Guidelines
The image presents a detailed flowchart outlining the principles of radiation therapy specifically for the treatment of cancer in the glottic larynx, as per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 2.2024). This structured guidance delineates various treatment protocols, stratified by risk levels and therapeutic approaches.

### Section Name: Principles of Radiation Therapy
#### Definitive: RT Alone
- **Tis, N0:** 60.75 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) to 66 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)  
- **T1, N0:**  
  - 63 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction, preferred) to 66 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) or  
  - 50 Gy (3.12 Gy/fraction) to 52 Gy (3.28 Gy/fraction)  
- **T2, N0:** 65.25 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)  
- **≥T2, N1:**  
  - **PTV High risk:** Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes (includes possible local subclinical infiltration at the primary site and at the high-risk level lymph node(s))  
    - Fractionation: 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily Monday–Friday in 6–7 weeks  
    - Concomitant boost accelerated RT:  
      - 72 Gy/6 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction, large field; 1.5 Gy boost as second daily fraction during last 12 treatment days)  
      - 66–70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction; 6 fractions/wk accelerated)  
    - Hyperfractionation: 79.2–81.6 Gy/7 weeks (1.2 Gy/fraction, twice daily)  
  - **Low to intermediate risk:** Sites of suspected subclinical spread  
    - 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)

### Section Name: Concurrent Systemic Therapy/RT
- **PTV High risk:** Typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)  
- **Low to intermediate risk:** 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)  

Based on published data, concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m²; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme (RTOG 0129). When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Other fraction sizes (e.g., 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach.  

In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/RT approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive care.

### Section Name: Treatment Modalities
Further breakdown in the guidelines suggests either Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or 3D Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) as delivery methods, contingent upon patient-specific considerations. These advanced techniques are employed to optimize treatment accuracy, preserving surrounding healthy tissue and improving overall patient outcomes. Moreover, a focus on concurrent systemic therapies underlines the importance of integrating chemotherapy, particularly for patients with more aggressive forms of cancer or those demonstrating advanced disease characteristics.

### Section Name: Additional Information
All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Clinical Trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged. Either IMRT (preferred) or 3D-CRT is recommended.

### Section Name: Conclusion
In summary, the flowchart succinctly encapsulates multifaceted treatment paradigms for glottic larynx cancer. It underscores the necessity of personalized treatment plans that adapt to the nuances of each patient's condition, promoting effective management and improved prognosis. This structured guideline aims to help healthcare professionals deliver clear, evidence-based interventions while considering the complexities involved in cancer treatment.

### Section Name: Flowchart Overview
The image presented is a detailed flowchart from the NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2024 concerning the assessment and management of cancer of the supraglottic larynx. This flowchart serves as a systematic guide for healthcare professionals to evaluate patient responses following treatment, particularly focusing on the evaluation of the primary site and determining subsequent steps based on observed outcomes.

### Section Name: Assessment and Treatment Decisions
At the top of the flowchart, the assessment begins with the definition of responses to initial treatments such as induction chemotherapy. Three main response categories are recognized: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and less than Partial Response (< PR). These categories are pivotal in determining the next steps. CR indicates full resolution of the disease at the primary site, leading to the consideration of definitive radiation therapy or the likelihood of surgery. Conversely, PR suggests that the disease has improved but not completely resolved, which directs the pathway towards either systemic therapy or continued radiation therapy, with further evaluation necessary.

### Section Name: Adverse Pathologic Features and Follow-up
The flowchart also accounts for the presence of adverse pathologic features — such as extranodal extension or positive margins — that can directly influence treatment decisions. If adverse features are found, surgical intervention is recommended. In cases where there are no adverse features, the patient may proceed directly to radiation therapy or continued systemic treatment, emphasizing the tailored approach based on the individual patient's disease characteristics.  

Furthermore, the chart includes a section addressing the follow-up process after initial treatment. If there are signs of recurrent or persistent disease, additional evaluations and treatment modalities may be necessary. These evaluations lead to specific recommendations for advanced disease management, denoted as ADV-3 on the chart, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment in cancer care.

It suggests a regimen involving conventional RT, particularly highlighting a total dose of 66 to 70 Gray (Gy) delivered in fractions of 2.0 Gy each. The schedule emphasizes daily treatments, indicating a typical 7-week plan.

### Section Name: Concurrent Therapy
It further elaborates on concurrent systemic therapy in combination with radiation treatment. High-risk patients may receive up to 70 Gy, while those with lower risks are advised to receive between 44 to 63 Gy, depending on their specific case. This section recommends careful consideration of systemic therapies like cisplatin, particularly every three weeks or in combination with pre-existing chemotherapy protocols.

### Section Name: Additional Techniques and Research
The document suggests employing either Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) as preferred treatment modalities. It mentions that proton therapy could be beneficial under specific conditions and stresses the importance of minimizing treatment toxicity. This part indicates ongoing research into the efficacy and safety of various radiation techniques.

### Section Name: Practical Recommendations
It includes practical recommendations for treatment sequencing, emphasizing a tailored approach based on individual patient circumstances, and highlights the importance of multi-disciplinary collaboration in treatment planning. There’s an implicit suggestion for careful patient management due to the complexity and risks of concurrent systemic therapies.

### Section Name: SUPRA-A 1 OF 2
1. **See Principles of Radiation Techniques (RAD-A) and Discussion.**  
2. For select T1–2, N0 tumors, accelerated fractionation may be used.  
3. For doses >70 Gy, some clinicians feel that the fractionation should be slightly modified (e.g., <2.0 Gy/fraction for at least some of the treatment) to minimize toxicity. An additional 2–3 doses can be added depending on clinical circumstances.  
4. Suggest 44–50 Gy in 3D-CRT and sequentially planned IMRT or 54–63 Gy with IMRT dose painting technique (dependent on dose per fraction).  
5. **Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancers (SYST-A).**  
6. Based on published data, concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m²; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme (RTOG).  
   - When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy.  
   - Other fraction sizes, multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach.  
   - In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/RT approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive care.

### Section Name: Principles of Radiation Therapy
1. **DEFINITIVE: RT Alone**  
   - T1–3, N0–1: 66–70 Gy conventional (2.0 Gy/fraction)  
   - **PTV**  
     - High risk: Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes [this includes possible local subclinical infiltration at the primary site and at the high-risk level lymph node(s)]  
       - Fractionation: 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily Monday–Friday in 6–7 weeks  
       - Concomitant boost accelerated RT:  
         - 72 Gy/6 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction, large field; 1.5 Gy boost as second daily fraction during last 12 treatment days)  
         - 66–70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction; 6 fractions/wk accelerated)  
       - Hyperfractionation: 79.2–81.6 Gy/7 weeks (1.2 Gy/fraction twice daily)  
     - Low to intermediate risk: Sites of suspected subclinical spread  
       - 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)

2. **CONCURRENT SYSTEMIC THERAPY/RT:**  
   - **PTV**  
     - High risk: Typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)  
     - Low to intermediate and low risk: 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)  
   - Either IMRT (preferred) or 3D-CRT is recommended.  
   - Use of proton therapy is an area of active investigation. Proton therapy may be considered when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy, or when photon-based therapy causes compromise of standard radiation dosing to tumor or postoperative volumes.

### Section Name: Diagnosis Section
At the top of the flowchart, the diagnosis segment is highlighted, initiating the decision-making process. It notes that for patients presenting with metastatic disease, a clinical trial is the preferred pathway, emphasizing the critical nature of innovative therapies in advanced cancer care. The option to "Consider locoregional treatment based on primary site algorithms" suggests that specific treatment strategies may be tailored depending on the exact location and characteristics of the cancer.

### Section Name: Treatment Pathways
The treatment section branches into various pathways depending on the patient’s performance status (PS), which is a measure of their general well-being and ability to function.  

- **For PS 0–1 Patients:**  
  The flowchart indicates several treatment options, including combination systemic therapy, single-agent systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy (RT). This group is highlighted as those who are most capable of handling intensive treatments and may benefit significantly from combination therapies.  

- **For PS 2 Patients:**  
  The recommended approach varies slightly, with a continued emphasis on systemic therapies, palliative radiation therapy, or best supportive care. This indicates a level of compromise in treatment options, suggesting that while aggressive treatment is still possible, the focus might shift more towards quality of life.  

- **For PS 3 Patients:**  
  The treatment options further narrow, still recommending systemic therapy or supportive care but highlighting palliative approaches, reflecting a recognition of the more advanced disease and potentially limited treatment efficacy.

### Section Name: Diagnosis
The diagnosis process for very advanced head and neck cancer involves categorizing patients based on their disease status. The guidelines differentiate between 'Recurrent or persistent disease' and 'Locoregional recurrence or persistent disease without prior RT (radiation therapy)'. This distinction is crucial as it influences subsequent treatment decisions. In cases of locoregional recurrence or persistent disease without prior RT, the disease can be classified as 'Resectable' or 'Unresectable'. If resectable, surgery is the preferred treatment. If unresectable, options include reirradiation with or without systemic therapy, and clinical trials are preferred.

### Section Name: Treatment of Very Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
The treatment of very advanced head and neck cancer involves several strategies. For resectable disease, surgery with or without postoperative reirradiation is recommended, and systemic therapy or RT is considered, with clinical trials preferred. For unresectable disease, reirradiation with or without systemic therapy is recommended, and best supportive care is considered. The guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical trials and suggest that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial.

### Section Name: Pathologic Features
Pathologic features play a significant role in determining the treatment approach. If no adverse pathologic features are present, observation and follow-up are recommended. However, if adverse pathologic features such as extranodal extension or positive margins are present, systemic therapy with RT is recommended. Other risk features may also warrant RT or systemic therapy with RT. The guidelines highlight the importance of considering these features in treatment planning.

### Section Name: Therapy for Persistent Disease
For persistent disease, the guidelines recommend therapy as indicated by the specific clinical scenario. This may include systemic therapy, RT, or a combination of both, depending on the presence of adverse pathologic features and other risk factors. The guidelines also suggest considering next-generation sequencing genomic profiling for biomarker identification to tailor treatment strategies.

### Section Name: Conclusion
The NCCN guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for the diagnosis and treatment of very advanced head and neck cancer. They emphasize evidence-based practices and the importance of clinical trials, advocating for an individualized approach to patient care. The guidelines serve as a critical resource for healthcare providers, ensuring that all potential treatment avenues are explored while considering patient-specific factors.

### Section Name: Diagnosis
In the **Diagnosis** section, the focus is on recurrent or persistent disease with distant metastases. Clinical trials are preferred for patients diagnosed at this stage. If there is locoregional failure, locoregional treatment should be considered based on the extent of the disease and symptoms presented. This highlights the importance of personalized treatment approaches, taking into account the unique circumstances of each patient.

### Section Name: Treatment
The **Treatment** section outlines pathways based on performance status (PS).  

- For **PS 0–1** patients, options include combination systemic therapy, single-agent systemic therapy, surgery, or best supportive care for those with limited metastases.  
- For **PS 2** patients, recommendations include single-agent systemic therapy, supportive care, or palliative treatments.  
- For **PS 3** patients, the focus is on single-agent therapy and best supportive care, with consideration of palliative radiation therapy (RT) and palliative surgery.  

This section addresses the evolving needs of patients as their performance status declines.

### Section Name: Persistent Disease or Progression
In the **Persistent Disease or Progression** section, the importance of continued evaluation of treatment efficacy is reiterated. Options include systemic therapy, clinical trials, or palliative care based on the specific patient condition. Best supportive care is emphasized, prioritizing the patient's quality of life, particularly in the context of advanced illness.

### Section Name: Principles and Considerations
- **Principles of Radiation Therapy (ADV-A).**  
- **Principles of Surgery (SURG-A).**  
- Consider NGS genomic profiling for biomarker identification.  
- Consider palliative RT as clinically indicated (e.g., bone metastases) (RAD-A).

### Section Name: NCCN Guidelines Overview
The image presents a flowchart from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Version 2.2024, especially focusing on follow-up recommendations for patients with head and neck cancers after systemic therapy or radiation therapy (RT).  

All recommendations are categorized as level A unless stated otherwise, highlighting the importance of clinical trials in cancer management.

### Section Name: Imaging and Assessment Protocols
1. After systemic therapy or RT, a clinical assessment should occur 4 to 8 weeks later. If there is a response, it is necessary to assess the extent of disease or distant metastases, preferably through a FDG-PET/CT scan at a minimum of 12 weeks post-treatment.  
   - If the FDG-PET/CT results are negative, the patient may continue with monitoring through observation.  
   - If the results are equivocal, observation or repeat FDG-PET/CT within 3 to 6 months is prescribed.  

2. In cases where the FDG-PET/CT results are strongly positive, further imaging via CT scan with contrast of the primary site and neck, or MRI with and without contrast, becomes necessary.  
   - If these imaging results confirm positive findings, neck dissection may be considered, depending on the evidence of residual or persistent disease.  
   - If the imaging findings are negative, the patient might continue in observation.  

### Section Name: Outcomes Based on Disease Resectability
The flowchart delineates different pathways based on whether the disease is resectable or unresectable:  

- If there is confirmed residual or persistent disease, the options split into two pathways: **'Unresectable'** or **'Resectable.'**  
  - **Unresectable:** Advances in treatment plans (labeled ADV-3) are called for.  
  - **Resectable:** A resection of the primary and/or neck dissection may occur, contingent upon the disease status.

### Section Name: Important Notes
- NCCN emphasizes that the best management for any cancer patient is participation in clinical trials, which is especially encouraged for all patients.  
- Additional notes clarify that if the FDG-PET/CT is negative for persistent cancer, further cross-sectional imaging is optional.  
  - **PET Negative:** Defined as no or low-grade uptake not suspicious for disease.  
  - **PET Positive:** Implies suspicion for disease.

### Section Name: PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING
Imaging plays an essential role in the clinical care of patients with head and neck cancer. The proper selection and utilization of imaging studies is critical in caring for patients with head and neck cancer.  

- **CT**: Performed with contrast, while CT imaging of the chest can be performed with or without contrast, as clinically indicated.  
- **MRI**: Performed with and without contrast, unless contraindicated.

### Section Name: Initial Workup - Primary Site
Imaging assessment of the primary site can be performed with:  
- **CT** of the soft tissues of the neck  
- **MRI** of the neck  

**CT** is complementary to MRI for head and neck cancers and is utilized to evaluate:  
- Cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion  
- Cartilage invasion  
- Bony erosion or destruction  

**MRI** is preferred over CT in certain conditions, such as:  
- Evaluating the extent of bone marrow invasion  
- Patients with extensive dental amalgam obscuring anatomy on CT  
- Assessing skull base invasion and cranial nerve involvement  
- Differentiating tumor from obstructed sinuses  

Complete evaluation of primary and nodal disease requires imaging from the skull base to the thoracic inlet, extending to the carina when involved lymph nodes or upper mediastinal cancers are present.

### Section Name: PET/CT and Biopsy
- If imaging does not reveal an obvious primary cancer, a **PET/CT** should be ordered before EUA, biopsies, and tonsillectomy. This helps identify potential primary sites before any interventions.  
- **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)** biopsy of metastatic nodes may provide pathologically informative results.  
- For initial diagnosis in cystic neck nodes, **image-guided needle biopsy** (ultrasound or CT) may yield better results than FNA by palpation alone.

### Section Name: Postoperative Imaging Advice
A **panoramic dental x-ray** is recommended for oral cavity cancers requiring mandibulotomy and/or mandibulectomy.  

- When postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is anticipated for areas like the lip, oral cavity subsites, or oropharynx, panoramic x-ray is essential for a comprehensive pre-radiation dental evaluation.  
- This evaluation helps assess the health of affected teeth and determine if pre-radiation dental procedures or extractions are necessary.

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers - Principles of Imaging
#### Principles of Imaging
1. **PET/CT** is preferred over PET scan alone (i.e., without superimposed CT scan). PET/CT provides more accurate anatomical localization of abnormalities.  
2. Pantvaidya GH, Agarwal JP, Deshpande MS, et al. PET-CT in recurrent head neck cancers: a study to evaluate impact on patient management. J Surg Oncol 2009;100:401-403.

### Section Name: Initial Workup - Nodal Metastases
#### Nodal Metastases
- Evaluation of lymph node metastases should be conducted with **CT or MRI** of the neck, using whichever imaging study is suitable for primary site evaluation (**IMG-A, 1 of 4**).  
- For patients with multistation or lower neck nodal involvement or high-grade tumor histology:  
  - **CT of the chest** may be performed to assess for mediastinal lymph node metastases.  
  - **FDG-PET/CT** is preferred due to its higher sensitivity for both nodal and distant metastases.  
- For patients under consideration for a **surgical primary approach**, the higher sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT is warranted for tumors near the midline to determine the surgical approach to the contralateral neck.  
- Patients scheduled for **definitive RT** may also benefit from FDG-PET/CT for identifying involved lymph nodes.

### Section Name: Initial Workup - Distant Metastases
#### Distant Metastases
- For patients with locoregionally advanced cancer (e.g., **T3–T4 primary or ≥N1 nodal staging**), **FDG-PET/CT** is preferred for evaluating distant disease and thoracic metastases.  
- **Limitations of FDG-PET/CT**:  
  - It cannot rule out brain metastasis. For concerns such as mucosal melanoma or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas or adenocarcinomas, a contrast-enhanced brain MRI should also be obtained.  
- If **FDG-PET/CT** is not performed:  
  - **CT of the chest** is used to assess for pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node involvement.  
  - Non-contrast chest CT can screen for lung parenchymal metastases but is not adequate for assessing mediastinal adenopathy.  

- **Screening for Lung Metastases:**  
  - Following primary definitive treatment (surgery, RT, or systemic therapy/RT), the role of annual **CT screening** for lung metastases is debated.  
  - Annual chest CT may be considered for patients with a substantial smoking history or high risk for lung metastases. Historically, annual chest x-rays have been used but are less sensitive than CT.

- **Directed Imaging for Specific Concerns:**  
  - If metastatic disease is suspected in specific anatomical areas, directed imaging can be performed, such as:  
    - **Non-contrast chest CT** for pulmonary metastasis  
    - **Contrast-enhanced spine MRI** for spinal metastasis  
  - Frequency of imaging depends on the treatment regimen and cancer type.

- **Role of FDG-PET/CT in Recurrent Disease Staging:**  
  - FDG-PET/CT may complement or replace other imaging modalities when staging recurrent disease before therapy for relapsed/refractory disease. It is used to explore distant disease or second primaries that could significantly impact therapy choice.

### Section Name: Locoregionally Advanced Disease: <6 Months Post-Treatment (Short-Term)
#### Locoregionally Advanced Disease: <6 Months Post-Treatment (Short-Term)
- Following surgery in patients with locoregionally advanced cancer, short-term post-treatment imaging is recommended for those who show signs of early recurrence or who are at high risk of early recurrence prior to starting adjuvant postoperative therapy.  
- Obtain **CT and/or MRI** within 3–4 months after surgical treatment for patients with locoregionally advanced disease or with altered anatomy causing challenging physical exam assessment, in order to establish a new baseline for future comparisons.  
- In cases of concern for incomplete response, a CT or MRI scan may be obtained much earlier, such as **4–8 weeks post-treatment** or even immediately based on the specific clinical situation. Ultrasound (US) of the neck for targeted sampling of any suspicious tissues may also be helpful, but results can be variably interpreted depending on the specific clinical situation.  
- **FDG-PET/CT** should be performed within **3–6 months** of definitive radiation or systemic therapy/RT for assessment of treatment response and to identify any residual tumor:  
  - Early FDG-PET/CT scans before 12 weeks are associated with significant false-positive rates and should be avoided in the absence of signs of recurrence or progression.  
  - The optimal timing of PET scans after radiation treatment appears to be at the **3- to 6-month window**. A negative PET at this time point predicts improved overall survival at 2 years.  
- In patients receiving definitive RT-based treatment of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma with **AJCC 7th edition N2–N3 nodal disease**, an FDG-PET/CT surveillance approach led to fewer neck dissections and considerable cost savings compared to a routine approach of planned post-treatment neck dissection. The majority of cases studied were **p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers**.  
- In the special case of patients who are treated initially with induction chemotherapy prior to the initiation of definitive therapy, either **CT or MRI** has typically been obtained after 2–3 cycles of induction. **Chest CT and/or FDG-PET/CT** (with diagnostic-quality imaging of the regions of the body at risk) may be obtained if there is concern for locoregional or distant metastatic progression.

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers
#### Locoregionally Advanced Disease: ≥6 Months to 5 Years Post-Treatment (Long-Term)
- The majority of recurrences after treatment of head and neck cancer occur in the first 2 years. Surveillance can be challenging due to altered anatomy and/or fibrosis from surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.  
- There are no consensus guidelines on the frequency and modality of routine post-treatment imaging in the asymptomatic patient, leading to wide variations in practice across institutions.  

**Imaging Modalities:**  
- **US, CT, MRI, and PET/CT** each have unique advantages and disadvantages for surveillance imaging.  
- Evidence suggests that **FDG-PET/CT** may be the most sensitive modality:  
  - A 12-month PET revealed recurrent or second primary cancers in ~10% of treated patients.  
  - A 24-month FDG-PET/CT revealed these findings in ~5% of treated cases.  

**Challenges and Considerations:**  
- Whether earlier detection through PET/CT leads to improved disease-specific survival is not established.  
- Standardized multi-institutional imaging-based trials are needed to assess the value of routine imaging in asymptomatic patients.  
- **Ho et al. findings:** No significant difference in 3-year disease-free survival between imaging surveillance and clinical surveillance (41% vs. 46%, P = .91).  
- If an FDG-PET/CT at 3 months post-treatment is negative, further routine imaging in asymptomatic patients may not provide substantial benefit.  

**Tailored Surveillance:**  
- A tailored approach to surveillance should consider:  
  - Tumor type, stage, prognostic factors, symptomatology, and physical exam changes or restrictions.  
- **US of the neck:** A well-established tool for nodal surveillance—safe, fast, inexpensive, and effective for detecting suspicious nodal disease.  

**Indications for Additional Imaging:**  
- Worrisome or equivocal signs/symptoms.  
- Routine annual imaging may be indicated to visualize areas inaccessible to routine clinical examination (deep-seated locations or areas obscured by treatment changes).

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers - Principles of Surgery
#### Head and Neck Cancers
### PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY
**Discussion**  

#### Evaluation
All patients should be evaluated by a head and neck surgical oncologist prior to treatment to ensure the following:  

- **Review biopsy material, staging, and imaging** to determine the extent of disease, exclude the presence of a synchronous primary tumor, assess current functional status, and evaluate potential surgical options, including those applicable if initial non-surgical treatment is unsuccessful.  
- **Pre-treatment evaluation** should include consultations with a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, dentist or oral maxillofacial surgeon, speech-language pathologist, dietitian, and reconstructive surgeon as appropriate.  
- **Tumor staging for untreated patients** is essential, based on diagnostic imaging studies and chest imaging as appropriate.  
- **Office-based head and neck examination** should include fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, and an EUA to assess tumor extent and obtain a biopsy. For metastatic carcinoma to the neck, an EUA is crucial to search for the putative primary site for diagnosis and treatment planning.  
- **Participate in multidisciplinary team discussions** to maximize survival while preserving form and function.  
- **Develop a surveillance plan** that includes:  
  - Adequate dental, nutritional, and health behavioral evaluations and interventions.  
  - Ancillary evaluations for comprehensive rehabilitation.  

---

### Section Name: Integration of Therapy
#### Integration of Therapy
- Multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment must be coordinated and integrated prospectively by all disciplines involved before initiating any treatment.  
- For surgical patients:  
  - Surgical procedures, margins, and reconstructive plans should ensure resection of all gross tumors with adequate tumor-free surgical margins.  
  - Surgical procedures should rarely be modified based on response to prior therapy, except in cases of tumor progression necessitating a more extensive procedure for definitive resection.  
- Multidisciplinary team decisions:  
  - The treatment regimen should be thoroughly discussed with the patient, covering risks, benefits, and potential outcomes.  
  - Shared decision-making should be encouraged, allowing the patient to participate in the final decision.

---

### Section Name: Clinical Trials
**Clinical Trials:**  
NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.

<hr>

## PAGE NO: 102
<hr>

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers - Principles of Surgery
#### Principles of Surgery
The surgical management of regional lymphatics is dictated by the extent of the tumor at initial tumor staging. These guidelines apply to the performance of neck dissections as part of treatment of the primary tumor.  
- In general, patients undergoing surgery for resection of the primary tumor will undergo dissection of the **ipsilateral side of the neck** that is at greatest risk for metastases.

---

### Section Name: Neck Management
#### Neck Management
- **Tumor sites with bilateral lymphatic drainage** (e.g., base of tongue, palate, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, deep pre-epiglottic space involvement) often require dissection of **both sides of the neck**.  
  - For tumors at or approaching the midline, both sides of the neck are at risk, necessitating **bilateral neck dissections**.  

- Advanced lesions involving the anterior tongue, floor of the mouth, or alveolus that cross the midline should undergo **contralateral selective/modified neck dissection** to ensure adequate tumor resection.  

- **Elective Neck Dissection:**  
  - Based on the **risk of occult metastasis** in the appropriate nodal basin.  
  - For oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, **sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN)** or the **primary tumor depth of invasion** is the best predictor of occult metastatic disease.  
  - For tumors with a depth greater than 3 mm, **elective dissection is strongly recommended** if RT is not already planned.  
  - Depth-based recommendations:  
    - **<2 mm:** Elective dissection only in highly selective cases.  
    - **2–4 mm:** Clinical judgment should guide decision-making, considering factors such as reliability of follow-up and clinical suspicion.  
    - Elective dissections are generally selective, preserving major structures unless dictated otherwise by operative findings.  

---

### Section Name: Types of Neck Dissection
#### Types of Neck Dissection
The type of neck dissection (comprehensive or selective) is determined by **preoperative clinical staging** and the surgeon's discretion based on tumor extent:  

- **N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis):**  
  - **Selective neck dissection:**  
    - Oral cavity: At least levels I–III  
    - Oropharynx: At least levels II–IV  
    - Hypopharynx: At least levels II–IV and level VI (as appropriate)  
    - Larynx: At least levels II–IV and level VI (as appropriate)  

- **N1–N2a–c (Regional lymph node metastasis):**  
  - Selective or comprehensive neck dissection (Discussion)  

- **N3 (Large nodal metastasis):**  
  - Comprehensive neck dissection  

- **Level VI neck dissections** are performed for certain primary sites (e.g., larynx and hypopharynx):  
  - Includes pretracheal lymph nodes, the Delphian lymph node, and unilateral or bilateral paratracheal lymph nodes.  
  - **Hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy** may also be appropriate.  

- For **subglottic tumors or glottic cancers with significant subglottic extension:**  
  - Level VI dissection with **unilateral or total thyroidectomy** is advised, based on tumor extent.  
  - Example: A **T4a glottic tumor** with cricothyroid membrane and subglottic extension should include thyroidectomy and pretracheal and bilateral paratracheal lymph node dissection.  

- **Parathyroid glands** should be preserved in situ or autotransplanted as necessary.

### Section Name: TNM Staging System for the Larynx - Regional Lymph Nodes (N)
The **NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2024** and the **AJCC TNM Staging System for the Larynx (8th ed., 2017)** provide a detailed classification of the **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)** for head and neck cancers. This classification is crucial for determining the presence and extent of lymph node metastases, which are critical in establishing the severity and appropriate treatment strategies.

#### Clinical N (cN)
- **NX**: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.  
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.  
- **N1**: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension, ENE(–).  
- **N2**:  
  - Metastasis in a single ipsilateral node, larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–);  
  - *or* metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–);  
  - *or* metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–).  
  - **N2a**: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–).  
  - **N2b**: Metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–).  
  - **N2c**: Metastases in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–).  
- **N3**:  
  - Metastasis in a lymph node, larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(–);  
  - *or* metastasis in any lymph node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+).  
  - **N3a**: Metastasis in a lymph node, larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(−).  
  - **N3b**: Metastasis in any lymph node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+).  

**Note**:  
- A designation of **“U” or “L”** may be used for any N category to indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (**U**) or below the lower border of the cricoid (**L**).  
- Clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as **ENE(−)** or **ENE(+)**.  

This structured classification is vital for clinicians for accurate staging and subsequent treatment planning in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancers.

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers - Management Approaches
#### Management Approaches
- Treatment decisions for head and neck cancers are guided by the **site of disease**, **histology**, **stage**, and **baseline comorbid conditions**.  
- **Single-modality treatment** with surgery or RT is typically recommended for **30% to 40% of patients** with early-stage disease (stage I or II) HPV-unrelated cancers.  
  - **Surgery** is usually preferred for oral cavity and paranasal sinus cancers.  
  - **RT (with or without chemotherapy)** is nearly always preferred for all stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and advanced HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer.  
- The choice between surgery or RT as a primary treatment modality often depends on local **institutional expertise** and the perceived relative morbidity of the options.  

**Evolving Treatment Techniques:**  
- Improvements in conformal RT techniques, less invasive surgery, and supportive care for systemic therapy have made morbidity a moving target.  

**Combined Modality Therapy:**  
- Generally recommended for the **60% of patients** with **locally or regionally advanced disease**.  
- Participation in **clinical trials** is a preferred option in many scenarios.  

**Guideline Development:**  
- These NCCN Guidelines are evidence-based while reflecting a consensus on an acceptable range of treatment options.  
- Population-based studies show better outcomes for patients treated at **high-volume centers**.

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers - Prognostic Factors
#### Prognostic Factors
- **p16 Positivity and HPV Status:**  
  Distinguishing patients by p16 positivity and HPV tumor status informs prognosis.  
  - **5-year Overall Survival (OS):**  
    - **p16-negative/HPV-positive:** 53.2% (95% CI, 46.6%–60.8%)  
    - **p16-positive/HPV-negative:** 54.7% (95% CI, 49.2%–60.9%)  
    - **Concordant p16-positive/HPV-positive:** 81.1% (95% CI, 79.5%–82.7%)  
    - **Concordant p16-negative/HPV-negative:** 40.4% (95% CI, 38.6%–42.4%)  

- **HPV and Survival:**  
  - Retrospective analysis (N = 1070) found better OS in patients with **HPV 16/18 positive sinonasal cancer** compared to HPV-negative disease (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48–0.82).  
  - Smoking and cancer stage significantly impact survival for patients with HPV-positive SCCHN.  
    - **Non-smokers** have a 51% (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.33–0.75) reduction in risk of cancer progression compared to smokers.  

- **Distant Metastasis and Prognosis:**  
  - No difference in the rate of distant metastasis in p16-positive vs. p16-negative patients was observed in RTOG 0129.  
  - Patients with **T4 or N3 disease** or radiographically detectable matted lymph nodes may have worse prognosis and are excluded from **deintensification trials**.  

**Implications for Treatment:**  
- Prognostic factors form the basis for **RT deintensification studies** in HPV-positive cancers.  
- The difference in prognosis between HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCHN led to the creation of new **AJCC staging criteria (2018)** for oropharyngeal cancers.  
  - Further details available in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers at [www.NCCN.org](http://www.NCCN.org).

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers Imaging
#### Imaging of Head and Neck Cancers
- Proper selection and utilization of imaging studies are essential for effective care:  
  - **CT and/or MRI** are used for initial imaging of the primary site.  
  - **MRI** is preferred for:  
    - Symptoms involving cranial nerves or tumors near the skull base.  
    - Differentiating tumor extent from obstructed sinuses or secretions.  
    - Evaluating intracranial/dural involvement.  
  - **CT** is complementary to MRI for:  
    - Evaluating bony erosion or cartilage invasion (e.g., laryngeal cancer).  
    - Assessing cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion in bone-involved cancers.  
  - **MRI** is used to evaluate bone marrow invasion and to delineate tumor boundaries (e.g., at the base of the tongue).  

- **Lymph Node Metastases:**  
  - CT or MRI can evaluate lymph node involvement, though **FDG-PET/CT** has superior accuracy.  
  - **FDG-PET/CT Evidence:**  
    - Meta-analysis (18 studies):  
      - **PPV:** 0.62 (95% CI, 0.55–0.69).  
      - **NPV:** 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79–0.86).  
    - ACRIN 6685 study (cN0 patients):  
      - 87% of negative PET scans were confirmed pathologically negative at neck dissection.  
    - German study (N = 150):  
      - **NPV:** 93.3% (95% CI, 88.2%–98.5%).  
    - PET/CT findings altered surgical plans in 22% of cases.  

- If metastasis to specific areas is suspected, directed imaging (e.g., contrast-enhanced chest CT, brain MRI) should be performed:  
  - Head and neck cancers rarely metastasize to the brain hematogenously, so routine brain studies are not necessary during initial workup.  

- **Panoramic Dental X-Ray:**  
  - Required before postoperative RT for dentulous patients as part of dental evaluation.  
  - Also useful for assessing dentition and mandibular height if marginal resection is planned.

### Section Name: Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes
#### Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes
- **Patient-completed scales** are critical for measuring Quality of Life (QOL) in head and neck cancer patients:  
  - **Validated Measures:**  
    1. **University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL)**  
    2. **EORTC-QLQ-H&N35** (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module)  
    3. **FACT-H&N** (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck scale)  

- **Performance Status Scale:**  
  - A clinician-rated scale widely used for evaluating patients' functional performance.  

- **Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire HN (OMWQ-HN):**  
  - A validated patient-reported tool measuring oral mucositis symptoms, including pain and its impact on well-being and function.  

- Use of the **Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)** is encouraged to assess symptomatic toxicity in clinical trials.

### Section Name: Head and Neck Cancers
#### Head and Neck Cancers
**MS-13**  

- The **College of Radiology** provides basic technical specifications for imaging and radiation techniques ([source](http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety)).  
- Consensus contouring guidelines for treating head and neck (H&N) cancers are especially useful for patients treated without surgery. [143,144]  

#### Radiation Dosages:
- When radiation is used with definitive intent:  
  - A standard dose of **70 Gy (2 Gy/fraction/day)** is prescribed for gross disease at primary sites like the lip, oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, glottic larynx, supraglottic larynx, occult primary, salivary gland tumors, and MM.  
  - A secondary dose (e.g., **60 Gy**) covers areas at higher risk for microscopic spread.  
  - Elective low-risk areas may receive lower doses (~**50 Gy**).  

#### Palliative RT:
- Various regimens exist, but no single regimen is preferred. [145,146]  
- Hypofractionated regimens are suitable for patients with limited life expectancy.  
  - Example: **QUAD SHOT regimen** delivers **44.4 Gy** in 12 fractions over three cycles, with 2–3 weeks between cycles. [147]  

---

### Section Name: Radiation Doses
#### Radiation Doses
- **Radiation dose prescription and delivery schedule** depend on:  
  - Primary tumor and neck node size.  
  - Use of altered fractionation.  
  - Clinical circumstances, including concurrent systemic therapy.  

- **Considerations for dose adjustments:**  
  - Proximity to organs at risk (e.g., brain, cochlea, optic chiasm/nerves, spinal cord).  
  - Precise target definition and on-treatment imaging are critical for accurate radiation delivery.  
  - Anatomical changes (e.g., tumor shrinkage, weight loss) may necessitate repeat imaging and treatment replanning.  

- **Definitive RT with conventional fractionation:**  
  - High-risk sites (primary tumor and lymph nodes): **66–70 Gy** (2.0–2.2 Gy/fraction). [148-151]  
  - Sensitive sites (e.g., neural structures): Modified fractionation (e.g., <2.0 Gy/fraction) may reduce toxicity, with additional fractions added if needed.  
  - Hyperfractionation for gross disease: Up to **81.6 Gy** (1.2 Gy/fraction) for tumors near sensitive areas like the brain or optic structures. [148,149]  
  - Care must be taken with doses >72 Gy to avoid normal tissue injury, though modern techniques (e.g., IMRT, IMPT) mitigate some risks. [148,152]  

- **Elective irradiation to low- and intermediate-risk sites:**  
  - **3D-CRT or IMRT:** Typically **44–50 Gy** (2.0 Gy/fraction).  
  - **Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) IMRT:** **54–63 Gy** (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction), depending on fractionation schedule and tumor risk in the area. [154-156]  

- **Mildly accelerated schedules:**  
  - Six fractions per week are commonly used in definitive RT, especially when chemotherapy is not given concurrently. [150]
