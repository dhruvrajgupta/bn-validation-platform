They are closely related to rabbits and are known for their distinctive vocalizations and behaviors.\\n\\n**Habitat and Distribution**\\nPikas thrive in cold, mountainous regions where they can find suitable talus habitats. However, recent studies indicate that their populations are declining in several areas due to climate change. The U.S. Geological Survey has reported that pikas are disappearing from certain locations in the western U.S., with significant variability in their presence across different regions. For instance, in the Great Basin and southern Utah, temperature and precipitation are strong predictors of pika presence, while in northeastern California, the availability of habitable talus is more critical for their persistence.\\n\\n**Impact of Climate Change**\\nAs climate change leads to declining snowpack and increasing temperatures, pika habitats are becoming more isolated.
