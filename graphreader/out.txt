QUESTION: What is the name of the castle in the city where the performer of Never Too Loud was formed?

RATIONAL PLAN:

        In order to answer this question, we first need to identify the following key pieces of information:

        1. The performer of the song "Never Too Loud."
        2. The city where this performer was formed.
        3. The name of the castle in that city.

*Updated Notebook*: 
The notebook currently contains no information. After analyzing the current node "Never Too Loud" and its atomic facts, we can add the following information to the notebook:
The performer of the song "Never Too Loud" is the Canadian hard rock band Danko Jones.

*Rationale for Next Action*: 
Based on the question and the rational plan, we need to identify the city where the performer was formed. The current atomic facts do not provide this information directly. However, they do provide some context about the album "Never Too Loud". Since the atomic facts only cover part of the information in the text chunk, it's possible that the text chunk may contain more information about the performer or the city. Therefore, it's worth reading the text chunk to get more complete information.

*Updated Notebook*: 
The notebook now contains the following information:
The performer of the song "Never Too Loud" is the Canadian hard rock band Danko Jones.
Never Too Loud is the fourth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Danko Jones.
The album "Never Too Loud" was recorded at Studio 606 in Los Angeles.
The album "Never Too Loud" was recorded at Studio 606 in Los Angeles, with the producer Nick Raskulinecz.
Studio 606 is a recording studio located in Los Angeles.

*Rationale for Next Action*: 
Since we are currently exploring the node "Studio 606", which is related to the city "Los Angeles", we need to find the castle in this city. The atomic fact "Never Too Loud was recorded at Studio 606 in Los Angeles." provides some information about the studio, but it does not mention the castle. Therefore, we should read the corresponding chunk to get more complete information.

Based on the given question, rational plan, previous actions, and notebook content, I analyzed that we have already gathered some information about the performer and the city where the album was recorded, but we still need to find the city where the performer was formed. Since the current node is 'Studio 606', and we have already explored its atomic facts and neighboring nodes, it's time to explore other nodes that might provide the missing information. Among the neighboring nodes of the current node, 'Los Angeles' seems to be a promising node to explore further, as it is already known to be the city where the album was recorded, and it might also be the city where the performer was formed.

However, it's possible that the text chunk C0 may contain more information about Los Angeles or the performer's origin. Since we haven't explored the text chunk C0 in the context of the current node Los Angeles, it's worth reading the chunk to gather more information.

*Updated Notebook*: 
The notebook now contains the following information:
The performer of the song "Never Too Loud" is the Canadian hard rock band Danko Jones.
Never Too Loud is the fourth studio album by Canadian hard rock band Danko Jones.

*Rationale for Next Action*: 
Since we have already explored the atomic facts of the node "Los Angeles" and we still need to find the name of the castle in the city where the performer was formed, which is Toronto, Canada, we should explore the chunks related to Toronto to gather more information.

*Chosen Action*: read_chunk(["C1", "C2", ...])

QUESTION: What is the name of the castle in the city where the performer of Never Too Loud was formed?

RATIONAL PLAN:

        In order to answer this question, we first need to identify the following key pieces of information:
