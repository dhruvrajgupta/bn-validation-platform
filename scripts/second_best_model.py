# Here we will use the dataset to perform Structure Learning
# so that it can be compared to the best model aka (LC/Mstage xdsl file)
# best model will be stored in the 'best_model' folder

# We will perform NOTEARS Structure Learning as it is the 
# current SOTA Structure Learning method
# CausalNex library already contains the method
