            <p>published in 2009 showed that surgery or RT have similar effectiveness 573
            (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in
            the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers), although the quality of
            studies comparing the effectiveness of RT and surgery in early laryngeal
            cancer is low.574 A systematic review including 48 studies of patients with
            T2 glottic cancer specifically showed no difference in 5-year local control
            between transoral surgery (1156 patients; 77.3%) and EBRT (3191
            patients; 75.8%).575 However, a meta-analysis including 11 studies
            showed that OS (P = .04) and laryngeal preservation (P < .001) were both
            better in patients who were treated with transoral laser microsurgery,
            compared to patients treated with RT.576 The choice of treatment modality
            depends on anticipated functional outcome, the patient’s wishes, reliability
            of follow-up, and general medical condition.577 In patients with significant
            pulmonary comorbidity, total laryngectomy may be preferable over
            endoscopic or open partial laryngectomy. Partial laryngeal surgery should
            be carefully considered if adjuvant RT is likely. Consideration should be
            given to any suspicious lymphadenopathy and risk of metastatic nodal
            disease. Neck dissection should be performed as indicated when the
            primary site is treated surgically. In patients with T1–2 node-negative
            cancer of the supraglottic larynx, lymph node dissection is associated with
            greater OS.578 T1–2 supraglottic cancers have a significant risk of occult
            nodal disease at presentation.</p>
            <p>Postoperative adjuvant treatment depends on the presence or absence of
            adverse pathologic features, such as margin status, nodal staging, and
            any extranodal extension. For cancer of the glottic larynx, subglottic
            extension is also considered an adverse pathologic feature. In the event of
            close or positive margins in organ preservation surgery, re-resection to
            negative margins may be considered. This may or may not require a total
            laryngectomy to achieve.</p>

            <p>Resectable, advanced-stage glottic and supraglottic primaries are usually
            managed with a combined modality approach (see Cancer of the Glottic
            Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for
            Head and Neck Cancers). If laryngeal preservation is desired, concurrent
            systemic therapy/RT is recommended, based on results from Intergroup
            trial RTOG 91-11.288,294 R91-11 was a successor trial to the VA trial and
            compared three non-surgical regimens: 1) induction cisplatin/5-FU
            followed by RT (control arm and identical to that in the VA trial); 2)
            concurrent RT and high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 days 1, 22, and 43; and
            3) RT alone. RT was uniform in all three arms (70 Gy/7 weeks, 2
            Gy/fraction), as was the option of surgery (including total laryngectomy) for
            relapsed/refractory disease in all arms. Patients with stage III and IV (M0)
            disease were eligible, excluding T1 primaries and high-volume T4
            primaries (tumor extending >1 cm into the base of the tongue or tumor
            penetrating through cartilage). The key findings of the R91-11 trial were: 1)
            a statistically significant higher 2-year laryngeal preservation (local control)
            rate of 88% for concurrent RT with cisplatin, compared to 74% for
            induction chemotherapy and 69% for RT alone; 2) no significant difference
            in laryngeal preservation between induction and RT alone treatments; and
            3) similar survival for all treatment groups. Based on these results,
            concurrent RT and systemic therapy (cisplatin preferred [category 1]) is a
            treatment option for achieving laryngeal preservation for T3, any N glottic
            and supraglottic cancers.294 Long-term follow-up (10 years) of R91-11
            indicates that laryngeal preservation continues to be better (ie, statistically
            different) with concurrent cisplatin/RT when compared with either induction
            chemotherapy or RT alone.288 OS was not statistically different for all
            treatment groups; there was more non–cancer-related mortality among
            patients treated with concurrent cisplatin/RT.</p>
            <p>Definitive RT (without systemic therapy) is an option for patients with T3,
            N0–1 disease who are medically unfit or refuse systemic therapy (see
