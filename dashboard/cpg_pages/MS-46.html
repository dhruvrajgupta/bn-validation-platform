            <p>NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Surgery is also an option
            for this patient population. For those patients whose disease persists after
            systemic therapy/RT or RT, surgical therapy is indicated (see Post
            Systemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in Follow-up
            Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).</p>

            <p>Induction chemotherapy with management based on response is an option
            for all but T1–2, N0 glottic and supraglottic cancers. Based on the long-
            term update of RTOG 91-11, induction chemotherapy is an option for
            patients who require (are amenable to) total laryngectomy. 288 After a
            complete or partial response with induction chemotherapy for patients with
            laryngeal cancer, RT alone is recommended (category 1) 288; systemic
            therapy/RT is a category 2B recommendation after a partial
            response302,303,579 (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the
            Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).</p>

            <p>For patients with glottic and supraglottic T4a tumors, the recommended
            treatment approach is total laryngectomy with possible hemi- or total
            thyroidectomy and appropriate neck dissection(s) followed by adjuvant
            treatment (RT or systemic therapy/RT) 580 (see Cancer of the Glottic
            Larynx, Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx, and Principles of Surgery in the
            NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For selected patients with
            T4a tumors who decline surgery, the NCCN Panel recommends: 1)
            considering concurrent systemic therapy/RT; 2) clinical trials; or 3)
            induction chemotherapy with additional management based on
            response.288,294</p>

            <h4>Radiation Therapy Fractionation</h4>
            <p>Fractionation for RT is discussed in the algorithm (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients with T1, N0 disease of the glottic larynx, an accelerated dosing schedule of 63 Gy (2.25</p>

        <!-- Right Column -->
        <div class="column">
            <p>Gy/fraction) is preferred over conventional fractionation (66 Gy, 2.0 Gy/fraction), based on results of a prospective randomized trial showing that this accelerated dosing schedule was associated with better 5-year local control, compared to a conventional dosing schedule (92% vs. 77%, respectively; P = .004), in 180 patients with stage I cancer of the glottic larynx.
                A dosing schedule of 50–52 Gy (3.12–3.28 Gy/fraction) may also be considered for patients with comorbidities, travel logistics, or who are older adults.</p>
            <h4>Follow-up/Surveillance</h4>
            <p>Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Serial endoscopy is recommended during follow-up examinations and may be supplemented with high-resolution, advanced radiologic imaging because of the scarring, edema, and fibrosis that occur in the laryngeal tissues and neck after RT-based treatment.</p>

            <h2>Paranasal Tumors (Maxillary and Ethmoid Sinus Tumors)</h2>
            <p>Tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare, and patients are often asymptomatic until late in the course of their disease. Tumors of the maxillary sinus are more common than those of the ethmoid sinus or nasal cavity. Workup is similar for ethmoid and maxillary sinus tumors (see Ethmoid Sinus Tumors and Maxillary Sinus Tumors in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).</p>
            <p>Although the most common histology for these tumors is squamous cell carcinoma, a variety of histologies have been reported including intestinal type adenocarcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma (also known as olfactory neuroblastoma), minor salivary gland tumors, and undifferentiated carcinoma (eg, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma [SNUC], small cell carcinoma, midline NUT carcinoma, and sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma [SNEC]).
