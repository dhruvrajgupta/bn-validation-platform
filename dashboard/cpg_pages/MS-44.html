            <p>complications were also less frequent in the hyperfractionation arm. It
                should be noted that, in this trial, hyperfractionation was not actually
                compared to standard fractionation, as the control arm of 60 Gy was
                delivered at 2.22 Gy/day, which is considered slightly hypofractionated for
                NPC. Nonetheless, because tolerability and late complications are a
                frequent concern associated with reirradiation, hyperfractionation to a
                lower total physical dose has high appeal as an attractive option for
                patients who are able to manage this rigorous twice-daily schedule.
                Recommendations regarding NPC reirradiation have been published, 567
                and reports describe a variety of technical approaches including IMRT,
                SBRT, and brachytherapy.568-570 In general, a fractionated course of IMRT
                in combination with concurrent chemotherapy is the most frequently used
                approach when the intent remains curative, with SBRT or more highly
                hypofractionated schedules (eg, ≥3 Gy/fraction) being more commonly
                used in cases of palliative intent.</p>
                <h4>Follow-up/Surveillance</h4>
                Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see
                Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck
                Cancers). Since the deep areas of the skull base are inaccessible to
                clinical examination, periodic cross-sectional imaging may be necessary.
                Likewise, inspection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa may be best
                accomplished with periodic endoscopy. The clinical benefit of plasma EBV
                DNA monitoring is not yet clearly defined (see Epstein-Barr Virus, above),
                but it may be considered in centers with experience (category 2B).</p>

            <h2>Cancer of the Larynx</h2>
            <p>The larynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. The distribution of cancers is as follows: 30% to 35% in the supraglottic region, 60% to 65% in the glottic region, and 5% in the subglottic region. The incidence and pattern of metastatic spread to regional nodes vary with the primary region. The lymphatic drainage of the glottis is sparse and</p>

        <div class="column">
            <p>early-stage primaries rarely spread to regional nodes. Because hoarseness is an early symptom, most glottic cancers are early stage at diagnosis. Thus, glottic cancer has an excellent cure rate of 80% to 90%. Nodal involvement adversely affects survival rates and is rare in T1–2 disease. In contrast, more than 50% of patients with supraglottic primaries present with spread to regional nodes because of an abundant lymphatic network that crosses the midline. Bilateral cervical metastases are not uncommon with early-stage supraglottic primaries. Thus, supraglottic cancer is often metastatic and higher stage at diagnosis. Subglottic cancer is not discussed, because it is uncommon.</p>

            <h4>Workup and Staging</h4>
            <p>The evaluation of the patient to determine tumor stage is similar for glottic and supraglottic primaries (see <i>Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of
                the Supraglottic Larynx</i> in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck
                Cancers). Multidisciplinary consultation is frequently indicated for both sites because of the potential impact on voice quality, speech, and swallowing functions
                (see <i>Principles of Nutrition: Management and
Supportive Care</i> in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). The 2017 AJCC staging classification (8th edition) for laryngeal primary tumors is determined by the number of subsites involved, vocal cord mobility, the presence of metastases, extranodal extension, and invasion of thyroid/cricoid cartilage (see Table 5).</p>

            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <p>In the NCCN Guidelines, the treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer is divided into two categories: 1) tumors of the glottic larynx; or 2) tumors of the supraglottic larynx.</p>
            <p>For patients with carcinoma in situ of the larynx, recommended treatment options include: 1) endoscopic resection, which is preferred; or 2) RT.
