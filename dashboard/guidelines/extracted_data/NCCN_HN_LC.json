        "content": "The image presents a flowchart from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Version 2.2024, specifically focusing on follow-up recommendations for patients with head and neck cancers following systemic therapy or radiation therapy (RT). \n\nIn the flowchart, the initial step begins after systemic therapy or RT, where a clinical assessment takes place 4 to 8 weeks later. If there is a response, further assessment of the extent of disease or distant metastases is required. The preferred method for this assessment is a FDG-PET/CT scan at a minimum of 12 weeks post-treatment. If the FDG-PET/CT results are negative, the patient may be monitored through observation. In cases where the results are equivocal, the flowchart directs to observe or repeat the FDG-PET/CT scan within 3 to 6 months.\n\nIf the FDG-PET/CT is strongly positive, further imaging through a CT scan with contrast of the primary site and neck, or an MRI with and without contrast, is necessary. If the imaging results are positive at this stage, a neck dissection may be considered upon confirmation of residual or persistent disease. Conversely, if the imaging results are negative, the patient might simply continue with observation.\n\nThe flowchart also addresses outcomes based on the resectability of the disease. If there is confirmed residual or persistent disease, the options diverge into \"Unresectable\" or \"Resectable.\" The unresectable pathway follows advances in treatment plans (labeled ADV-3), while the resectable pathway suggests resection of the residual primary and/or neck dissection, contingent on the disease's status.\n\nA note at the bottom emphasizes that all recommendations are categorized as level A unless stated otherwise, and reinforces the importance of clinical trials in the management of cancer care. This summarized flowchart thus serves as a critical guide for healthcare professionals in determining post-therapeutic evaluation and potential further interventions for patients diagnosed with head and neck cancers."

IMRT is** **preferred for thyroid cancers because of its ability to spare the larynx, brachial plexus, and esophagus. ** The application of IMRT to other sites (eg, oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx) is preferred and may be used at the discretion of treating **physicians. ** Helical tomotherapy and VMAT are advanced forms of IMRT. *** PBT** Achieving highly conformal dose distributions is especially important for patients whose primary tumors are periocular in location and/ **or invade the orbit, skull base, and/or cavernous sinus; extend intracranially or exhibit extensive perineural invasion; and who are being** **treated with curative intent and/or who have long life expectancies following treatment. Nonrandomized single-institution clinical reports** **and systematic comparisons demonstrate safety and efficacy of PBT in the above-mentioned specific clinical scenarios. ** Proton therapy can be considered when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy, or when photon-based therapy **causes compromise of standard radiation dosing to tumor or postoperative volumes. ** *** IMRT, PBT, and Fractionation** A number of ways exist to integrate IMRT or PBT, target volume dosing, and fractionation. - **The SIB technique uses differential \"dose painting\" (66-72 Gy to gross disease; 44-63 Gy to subclinical disease) for each fraction of** **treatment throughout the entire course of radiation. SIB is commonly used in the conventional (5 fractions/wk) and the \"6 fractions/wk** **accelerated\" schedule. ** - **The sequential (SEQ) technique typically delivers the initial (lower dose) phase (weeks 1-5) followed by the high-dose boost volume** **phase (weeks 6-7) using 2-3 separate dose plans, and is commonly applied in standard fractionation and hyperfractionation. ** - **The concomitant boost accelerated schedule may utilize a \"modified SEQ\" dose plan by delivering the dose to the subclinical targets** **once a day for 6 weeks, and a separate boost dose plan as a second daily fraction for the last 12 treatment days. ** - **Another accelerated approach, aside from concomitant boost, is to simply treat 6 fractions per week. ** Altered fractionation may be used for select patients with comorbidities who are not good candidates for 6-7 weeks of adjuvant RT or **systemic therapy/RT. ** Altered fractionation has not proven to be beneficial in the context of concurrent chemotherapy.

This table systematically enumerates various anatomical structures associated with radiation therapy, specifying dose constraints to ensure patient safety during treatment. The guidelines emphasize the importance of dose limits, represented by specific terms, such as \"D95 = 95% of the volume\" and \"D max = maximum dose to 0.03 cc of the volume,\" clarifying the parameters for dose delivery.\n\nIn the first section of the table, it lists various structures, including \"Bone Mandible,\" \"TMJ,\" \"Brachial Plexus,\" and others, followed by their corresponding dose constraints. For example, the \"Bone Mandible\" has a maximum dose of less than 70 Gy, while the \"TMJ\" can tolerate a dose of up to 75 Gy under certain conditions. The guidelines further specify mean dose limits for structures such as the \"Parotid\" and \"Submandibular Glands,\" indicating a mean dose allowance of less than 26 Gy and 39 Gy or 40 Gy, respectively. \n\nOther key entries include the \"Spinal Cord,\" which has a maximum dose of 45 Gy, and the \"Brainstem_PRV03,\" limited to a dose of 54\u201358 Gy. The constraints for sensitive organs, such as the \"Cochlea,\" \"Optic Nerve,\" and \"Eyes,\" are also presented with specific dose limits to mitigate risks of radiation-induced damage. This detailed and systematic approach reflects the level of specificity required in radiation oncology to ensure optimal outcomes while minimizing potential harm to surrounding healthy tissues. \n\nAdhering to these guidelines is critical for healthcare professionals in planning effective and safe radiation therapy protocols for patients diagnosed with head and neck cancers.

The flowchart structure helps categorize various treatment regimens and their indications, facilitating quick reference for healthcare professionals.\n\nThe **\"Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancers\"** outlines key principles, emphasizing the significance of individualizing systemic therapy based on patient characteristics. The document suggests that next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic profiling plays a critical role in determining the most suitable treatment plans and that the preferred concurrent chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally advanced disease is a combination of cisplatin and radiation.\n\nThe primary systemic therapy options combined with concurrent radiation therapy (RT) are clearly delineated. **Preferred regimens** include high-dose cisplatin (category 1) and carboplatin with infusion of 5-FU (category 1). Other recommended regimens extend options to weekly cisplatin and carboplatin/paclitaxel (category 2B), with particular circumstances noted where docetaxel may be utilized, especially in patients deemed ineligible for cisplatin based treatments.\n\nUnder the **\"Induction/Sequential Systemic Therapy\"** section, the preferred regimens are again highlighted. Notably, docetaxel is listed as a primary option, with additional recommendations for paclitaxel and carboplatin/placlitaxel in specific contexts. This underscores the variability and adaptability of treatment protocols based on patient condition and tumor characteristics.\n\nThe **postoperative systemic therapy** section reviews the management after induction therapy, with preferences leaning towards cisplatin for patients classified as high-risk, while also including alternative regimens such as docetaxel when applicable. \n\nOverall, the chart serves as a comprehensive guide for clinicians, summarizing complex treatment strategies while noting the importance of clinical trials and individual patient assessment in managing non-nasopharyngeal cancers effectively. Specific considerations around the use of chemotherapy and radiation therapies highlight both the risks involved, particularly relating to cisplatin treatment, and the need for customized patient approaches as outlined in the NCCN guidelines."

        "content": "The image provided contains a table from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines regarding the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system for laryngeal cancers. This table outlines the classification of primary tumors in relation to their anatomical and functional characteristics. It pertains specifically to laryngeal cancer, detailing various classifications based on tumor size, location, and extent of invasion.\n\nThe table starts with \"Primary Tumor (T)\" assessments, listed as TX, Tis, and values from T1 through T4. The term \"TX\" signifies that the primary tumor cannot be assessed, while \"Tis\" indicates carcinoma in situ, signifying a localized tumor that has not invaded deeper tissues. Following this, the classifications from T1 to T4 provide an indication of the tumor's progression. For example, T1 denotes that the tumor is limited to one subsite of the supraglottis with normal vocal cord mobility, while T2 indicates the tumor invades adjacent structures and mucosal surfaces beyond the supraglottis.\n\nFurther classifications delve into T3 and T4, with T3 indicating fixation of the larynx and potential invasion into surrounding structures, while T4 and its subcategories (T4a and T4b) describe more advanced local disease. T4a notes invasion through the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage or significant encroachment on adjacent tissues, whereas T4b specifies invasion into critical structures such as the carotid artery or mediastinal areas, marking it as very advanced local disease.\n\nAdditionally, the table also covers \"Subglottis\" tumors, providing respective T classifications that parallel those of glottic and supraglottic tumors. Each classification outlines specific criteria regarding tumor mobility and extent, reinforcing the significance of both anatomical involvement and functional impairments due to the tumor's presence.\n\nIn summary, this table serves as a detailed reference for healthcare professionals to accurately stage laryngeal tumors, facilitating standardized communication, treatment planning, and prognostic evaluation in clinical oncology."

This document elaborates on the classification criteria utilized for determining the presence and extent of lymph node metastases, which are critical in establishing the severity and appropriate treatment strategies for head and neck cancers.\n\nThe table categorizes **Clinical N (cN)** into several classifications: **NX**, indicating that regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed; **N0**, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis; and various classifications under **N1** to **N3**, which specify the size and extent of metastasis in lymph nodes either unilaterally or bilaterally. The classification ranges from **N1**, where there is a single lymph node metastasis of 3 cm or smaller, to **N3**, which encompasses significantly larger metastases (greater than 6 cm) or clinically overt extranodal extension (ENE). Variants such as **N2a**, **N2b**, and **N2c** detail metastases based on specific size criteria and the location of nodes (ipsilateral or contralateral) involved in the metastasis.\n\nThe note at the bottom highlights the designation of **\u201cU\u201d or \u201cL\u201d** for categorizing certain metastases, particularly those above or below defined anatomical landmarks like the lower border of the cricoid. Additionally, it emphasizes that both clinical and pathological evaluations should be recorded with respect to ENE, either as negative (ENE(\u2212)) or positive (ENE(+)). This structured classification is vital for clinicians for accurate staging and subsequent treatment planning in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancers."

        "content": "The image presents a segment from the NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2024, specifically focusing on the staging of head and neck cancers as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Within this document, several critical tables and categorizations are clearly laid out, detailing the TNM staging system for laryngeal cancers, following criteria established in the 8th edition of their manual from 2017.\n\nThe first component discussed is **Pathological N (pN)**, which categorizes regional lymph node involvement in cancers. The classifications here include: **NX** (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed), **N0** (no regional lymph node metastasis), **N1** (single ipsilateral lymph node metastasis, \u22643 cm), and progressively through **N2a**, **N2b**, **N2c**, and finally **N3**, each with specific criteria regarding the size and number of lymph nodes affected, as well as the presence or absence of extranodal extension (ENE). This detailed classification is essential for determining the extent of disease spread within the lymphatic system.\n\nMoreover, the **Distant Metastasis (M)** section elaborates on the metastatic status, distinguishing between **M0** (no distant metastasis) and **M1** (presence of distant metastasis). Additionally, the **Histologic Grade (G)** section specifies grades from **GX** (grade cannot be assessed) to differentiated categories ranging from **G1** (well differentiated) to **G3** (poorly differentiated). This grading system plays a pivotal role in understanding tumor behavior and treatment responsiveness.\n\nThe paragraph concludes with the **Prognostic Stage Groups**, which organizes stages from **Stage 0** (Tis N0 M0) to **Stage IV** classifications, indicating increasingly advanced disease status, culminating in **Stage IVB** and **Stage IVC** for various tumor sizes and locations, highlighting clinical implications for treatment strategies.\n\nIn summary, the document serves as a critical reference tool for oncologists, enabling them to categorize and stage head and neck cancers accurately, ensuring effective treatment planning based on the specific characteristics of the cancer."

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers #### Overview The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines[(r)]) for Head and Neck Cancers address tumors arising from the oral cavity (including mucosal lip), pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses. Occult primary cancers, salivary gland cancers, and mucosal melanoma (MM) are also addressed. In 2023, it is estimated that about 66, 920 new cases of oral cavity, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers will occur, which account for approximately 3. 4% of new cancer cases in the United States. An estimated 15, 400 deaths from head and neck (H&N) cancers will occur during the same time period. Squamous cell carcinomas account for more than 90% of these tumors. Tobacco and alcohol use disorders are the most common etiologies for oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-unrelated oropharynx cancers. Patients with H&N cancers due to tobacco and alcohol are at risk for harboring synchronous primary tumors and developing second primary neoplasms of the H&N, lung, esophagus, bladder, and other potential sites that are exposed to these carcinogens. Stage at diagnosis predicts survival rates and guides care of patients with H&N cancers. In general, stage I or II disease defines a relatively small primary tumor with no nodal involvement amongst HPV-unrelated cancers. Stage III or IV HPV-unrelated cancers and stages I, II, and III HPV-related cancers may include larger primary tumors, which may invade underlying structures and/or spread to regional nodes. Distant metastases are less common at presentation as compared to lung and esophagus cancers. More advanced TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) stages are associated with worse survival. An Squamous cell carcinomas account for more literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. lower-level evidence and expert opinion. #### Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage #### Guidelines Update Methodology The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www. NCCN. org. #### Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology Prior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in H&N cancers published since the previous Guidelines update, using the following search terms: (head and neck cancer) OR (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) OR (lip cancer) OR (oral cavity cancer) OR (oropharynx cancer) OR (hypopharynx cancer) OR (nasopharynx cancer) OR (larynx cancer) OR (paranasal tumor) OR (ethmoid sinus tumor) OR (maxillary sinus tumor) OR (salivary gland tumor) OR (mucosal melanoma head) OR (mucosal melanoma neck) OR (recurrent metastatic head neck cancer). The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel's review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. #### Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, antimisogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-weight-biased; and inclusive f i di id l f ll l i t ti d d id titi NCCN -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses. #### Human Papillomavirus Infection HPV infection is a predominant cause of squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx (particularly cancers of the tonsils and tongue base). However, small subsets of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, nasopharynx, and paranasal sinuses are HPV positive, and 50% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the H&N are HPV positive. The overall incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx cancers is increasing in the United States, particularly in men, while the incidence of HPV-negative (primarily tobacco- and alcohol-related) cancer is decreasing. The attributable fraction for HPV in newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer is estimated as 60% to 70% in the United States and parts of the European Union.

Patients with HPV-positive cancer however, HPV-positive oropharynx cancer HPV16 infection increases the risk of oropharynx cancer, and a strong causal relationship has been established. HPV16 accounts for ~90% of cases, and HPV18, 33, and 35 are responsible for the vast j it f th ll i i f ti 9 Th l f HPV16 i higher in oropharyngeal cancer than in cervical cancer (~50%), in which HPV18 is also highly prevalent. [14, 23-25] Expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes inactivates the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, respectively, which are frequently mutated in tobacco-related mucosal squamous cell carcinomas. Inactivation of p53 and pRb promotes genomic instability and the development of cancer and is responsible for the upregulation of p16 protein expression, a reliable surrogate marker of the presence of HPV DNA in these tumors. Genetic profiling of HPV-positive cancer has demonstrated it to be genetically distinct from HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Analyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2014), including 2627 adults aged 18 to 33 years, showed that HPV vaccination was associated with reduced vaccine-type oral HPV infection (0. 1% in vaccinated individuals vs. 1. 6% in unvaccinated individuals; P = . 008). Moreover, HPV vaccination in the United States has led to herd protection against oral HPV16, 18, 6, and 11 infections in unvaccinated males. Results of an ongoing randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of HPV vaccines for the prevention of oral HPV infections have not yet been reported. While data are not yet available, the HPV types that cause the overwhelming majority of SCCHN are included in the HPV nonavalent vaccine (provides protection against nine high-risk HPV types). Since there is evidence that vaccination prevents HPV-related cervical and anal cancers, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication for HPV vaccination to include prevention of oral HPV infections and related oropharyngeal cancers in 2020. Patients with locally advanced HPV-positive SCCHN have improved response to treatment and survival (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS]) when compared with HPV-negative tumors.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers #### Management Approaches The specific site of disease, histology, stage, and baseline comorbid conditions guide treatment decisions (eg, the appropriate surgical procedures, radiotherapy treatment parameters [target volumes, total dose, and fractionation regimen], indications for systemic therapy, and patient-specific considerations). Single-modality treatment with surgery or RT is generally recommended for the approximately 30% to 40% of patients who present with early-stage disease (stage I or II) HPV-unrelated cancers. Surgery and RT result in similar survival for many H&N cancers, but surgery is usually preferred for oral cavity and paranasal sinus cancers, while RT with or without chemotherapy is nearly always preferred for all stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and more advanced stages of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. The choice of surgery or RT as the primary treatment modality is often based on local institutional expertise and/or perceived relative morbidity of these treatment options. With the evolution of conformal techniques of RT and less invasive surgery, as well as improving supportive care for patients receiving systemic therapy, morbidity is also a moving target. Combined modality therapy is generally recommended for the approximately 60% of patients Participation in clinical trials is a preferred or recommended treatment option in many situations. In formulating these NCCN Guidelines, panel members have tried to make them evidence-based while providing a statement of consensus as to the acceptable range of treatment options.

However, patients with tumors that are HPVnegative/p16-positive had greater 5-year OS, compared to patients with tumors that are p16-negative (regardless of HPV status). Discrepancies between HPV status and p16 status are usually attributable to use of assays for HPV detection that do not cover all high-risk HPV types. The impact of smoking and cancer stage on survival of patients with HPVpositive SCCHN has been investigated in numerous studies. For example, analyses of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were enrolled in RTOG 9003 or 0129 (n = 165) showed that smoking was associated with decreased OS and PFS, regardless of p16 status. An analysis of data compiled from four cooperative group trials estimated that those who never smoked had a 51% (HR, 0. 40; 95% CI, 0. 33-0. 75) reduction in risk of cancer progression when compared to those who formerly or currently smoked and had HPV-positive SCCHN. A retrospective analysis from a clinical trial (RTOG 0129) showed no difference in the rate of distant metastasis in patients with p16-positive versus p16-negative disease. Additional analyses have suggested that individuals with T4 or N3 disease or radiographically detectable matted lymph nodes may have a worse prognosis, and therefore should be excluded from deintensification trials. These studies on prognostic and predictive factors in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers form the basis for RT deintensification studies. Moreover, the striking difference in prognosis for HPV-positive versus HPV-negative SCCHN led to the creation of new AJCC staging criteria in 2018 (see Cancer of the _Oropharynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers;_ available at www.

Similarly, managing and preventing sequelae following surgery, RT, and systemic therapy (eg, trismus, pain, lymphedema and muscle spasm of the neck, xerostomia, dysphagia, speech and swallowing problems, dental and jaw decay, depression, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, renal failure) requires professionals familiar with these diseases. Follow-up for such sequelae should include a comprehensive H&N examination, supportive care, and rehabilitation (see Follow-Up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Adequate nutritional support can help to prevent severe weight loss in patients receiving treatment for H&N cancers and shorten post-treatment recovery times; therefore, patients should be encouraged to consult with a registered dietitian at diagnosis, during, and after treatment as needed (see Principles of _Nutrition: Management and Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for_ Head and Neck Cancers). Dental care to prevent and treat radiationrelated effects should be provided (see Principles of Dental Evaluation and _Management in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ Evaluation by a speech-language/swallowing therapist before and after treatment is also highly recommended. Evaluation and management of lymphedema and trismus should be conducted as clinically indicated with appropriate referrals to occupational and physical therapy.

Cigarette smoking is associated with at least 30% of cancer deaths, and, therefore, patients' history of tobacco use must be assessed. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking (and remain abstinent in particular during treatment with RT) and to modify excessive alcohol consumption. These habits cannot only decrease the efficacy of treatment, but adversely affect other health outcomes. Information on smoking cessation resources and support can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation (available at www. NCCN. org). **Resectable Versus Unresectable Disease** The NCCN Member Institutions have teams experienced in the comprehensive treatment of H&N cancers and maintain the multidisciplinary infrastructure needed for reconstruction and rehabilitation. A patient's cancer is deemed unresectable if H&N surgeons at NCCN Member Institutions do not think they can remove the gross tumor on anatomic grounds or if local control is unlikely to be achieved with surgery (even with the addition of RT to the treatment approach). Typically, these unresectable tumors densely involve the prevertebral fascia, cervical vertebrae, skull base, brachial plexus, deep muscles of the neck, mediastinal structures, or critical H&N vasculature (see Principles of _Surgery in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ Unresectable tumors are associated with overall poor prognosis. Unresectable tumors should be distinguished from inoperable tumors in those patients whose constitutional state of health precludes an operation (even if the cancer could be readily resected with few sequelae). Additionally, a subgroup of patients will decline surgical management, but their tumors should not be deemed unresectable.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers disease is considered functionally unresectable. Examples include bilateral orbital exenteration or exenteration in the only seeing eye, extensive mandibular resection without reconstruction options, or total pharyngectomy when reconstitution of the alimentary tract is not feasible. Although these are rare occurrences, the impact on quality of life (QOL) and the need for continual supportive care are significant and open-ended. Although local and regional disease may be surgically treatable, patients with distant metastases may not benefit from surgery, and therefore their disease is deemed inoperable. In incurable situations, surgery may still be considered for symptom palliation in select cases. Thus, patient choice or a physician's expectations regarding cure and morbidity will influence or determine treatment. Patients with locally advanced but resectable tumors, who can also be adequately treated without surgery, represent a very important group that is distinct from patients with unresectable disease. Definitive treatment with RT alone or RT combined with systemic therapy may represent equivalent or preferable approaches to surgery in these individuals. Although such patients may not undergo surgery, their tumors should not be labeled as unresectable. Their disease is usually far less extensive than those with disease that truly cannot be removed. #### Comorbidity and Quality of Life **Comorbidity** Comorbidity refers to the presence of concomitant disease(s) (in addition to H&N cancers) that may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Documentation of comorbidity is important to facilitate optimal treatment selection. Comorbidity is known to be a strong independent predictor for mortality in patients with H&N cancers, and it also influences QOL and uniquely human characteristics (ie, appearance, voice). limitations.

The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) is a validated instrument for assessing comorbidity in numerous cancer types including H&N cancers. An important consideration when interpreting published clinical trial data is the applicability of the results to patients with significant comorbidities, who may have been ineligible/excluded from such studies. **Quality of Life** Health-related QOL issues are important in patients with H&N cancers. These tumors affect the patient's basic physiologic functions (ie, the ability to chew, swallow, and breathe), the senses (ie, taste, smell, hearing), and uniquely human characteristics (ie, appearance, voice). Health status describes an individual's physical, emotional, and social capabilities and limitations. Function and performance refer to how well an individual is able to perform important roles, tasks, or activities. QOL differs because the central focus is on the value (determined by the patient alone) that individuals place on their health status and function. Patient-completed scales should be used to measure QOL. Three validated and accepted measures for H&N cancer-specific issues are: 1) the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL);2) the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (EORTC-QLQ-H&N35);and 3) the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT-H&N) scale. The Performance Status Scale is a clinician-rated performance scale that is widely used for patients with H&N cancers. The Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire HN (OMWQ-HN) is a validated patient-reported instrument that measures the symptoms of oral mucositis, including mouth and throat pain, and its impact on well-being and function. #### Imaging of Head and Neck Cancers Appropriate selection and utilization of imaging studies is crucial for proper care of patients with H&N cancers.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers encroach on the skull base. CT, however, is complementary to MRI for evaluation of bony erosion or cartilage invasion that may occur with some H&N tumors (eg, laryngeal cancer). In patients with oral cavity cancers that involve the bone, MRI is needed to evaluate the extent of bone marrow invasion, while CT may be appropriate to evaluate cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion. For cancers originating in the base of the tongue, MRI can often delineate the boundary between gross tumor and normal muscle more effectively than CT. In patients with sinonasal tumors, MRI is useful for differentiating tumor extent from obstructed sinuses or secretions and to evaluate intracranial/dural involvement. Evaluation of lymph node metastases can be done with either CT or MRI, depending on the primary site, although both have lower accuracy as compared with FDG PET/CT. Ultimately, choosing CT or MRI should be driven by the information desired as both are not routinely indicated. There is evidence to support the superiority of FDG PET/CT for detecting locoregional nodal and distant metastases in patients with H&N cancers. A meta-analysis including 18 studies showed that the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of FDG PET/CT for detection of cervical lymph node involvement in patients with clinically node-negative SCCHN was 0. 62 (95% CI, 0. 55-0. 69) and 0. 83 (95% CI, 0. 79-0. 86), respectively. Analyses from the prospective ACRIN 6685 study (SCCHN; 64% oral cavity) showed that, in patients with cN0 disease, 125/144 (87%) negative PET scans were pathologically negative at neck dissection. Findings from PET/CT changed the surgical plan in 22% of patients. A prospective single-center study from Germany (N = 150) showed an NPV of 93. 3% (95% CI, 88. 2%-98. 5%) for detection of cervical lymph node metastases by FDG PET/CT.

Analyses from the prospective ACRIN 6685 therapy. Findings from PET/CT changed the surgical plan inIf there is concern about metastasis to a specific anatomic area, then directed CT or MRI may also be performed (eg, contrast-enhanced chest CT to evaluate pulmonary metastases and/or mediastinal lymph node involvement; contrast-enhanced brain MRI for evaluation of brain metastases or skull base invasion). H&N cancers rarely metastasize to the brain by a hematogenous route. Therefore, ordering a full brain study as part of the initial imaging workup is not routine. For patients who are dentulous and expected to receive postoperative RT, a panoramic dental x-ray should be completed before treatment as part of the dental evaluation (see Principles of Dental Evaluation and _Management in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ Panorex is also helpful for evaluation of dentition and mandibular height if a marginal resection is being considered. **Short-Term Evaluation of Locoregionally Advanced Disease** Imaging is often part of response assessment following definitive therapy. Careful consideration should be given as to the type of imaging performed. It is unlikely all three modalities (CT, MRI, and FDG PET/CT) will be needed, and this may add cost and inconvenience without significant added value. Patients treated with induction chemotherapy may receive imaging with CT or MRI after two to three cycles of chemotherapy. If there is high concern for distant metastasis, a chest CT or FDG PET/CT may be needed to evaluate whether to proceed to the planned definitive local therapy. For patients with locoregionally advanced disease who have undergone surgery, postoperative imaging is recommended if there are signs of early recurrence or for patients considered high risk of early recurrence. This may be needed to evaluate whether to proceed to the planned adjuvant radiation-based therapy and/or to determine targets and dosing of radiation in case of unexpected recurrence. Patients with positive margins, advanced T or N stage, or oral cavity cancers are at particular risk for rapid recurrence after surgery. -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers After definitive-intent treatment completion, the panel generally recommends imaging 3 to 4 months after the end of treatment, or as early as 4 to 8 weeks after definitive treatment if there is concern about an incomplete treatment response. Of note, proximity to recent treatment can complicate interpretation of radiographic studies, and communication with the interpreting radiologist is important to distinguish recurrent disease from post-treatment effect. Positive PET results can be particularly difficult to interpret earlier than 12 weeks following treatment, as shown in multiple prospective and retrospective studies. Careful and regular follow-up examinations are recommended so that any local or regional recurrence is detected early. After RT-based treatment, evaluation with imaging (ie, CT and/or MRI with contrast or FDG PET/CT) guides the use of neck dissection (see Follow-Up Recommendations: Post _Systemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for_ Head and Neck Cancers). A meta-analysis of 27 studies showed that the PPV and NPV for PET or PET/CT to detect local residual or recurrent disease were 52. 7% and 96. 3%, respectively, and 72. 3% and 88. 3%, respectively, for detection of nodal residual or recurrent disease. If PET/CT is used for follow-up, the first scan should be performed at a minimum of 12 weeks after treatment to reduce the false-positive rate. PET/CT surveillance in patients with advanced nodal disease who received systemic therapy/RT yielded a comparable survival rate and QOL and may be more cost-effective, relative to planned neck dissection.

H&N cancer recurrence 12 months after treatment. Note that a complete clinical response (ie, clinically negative) may be defined as no visible or palpable evidence of residual disease and no concerning findings on CT or MRI;a complete pathologic response requires pathologic confirmation. If a complete clinical response to RT based treatment has been achieved, then the panel recommends observing the patient. In patients who have a clinically negative neck, PET/CT is associated with NPVs ranging from 97% to 100%. Panel members also concur that any patient with residual disease after RT-based treatment should be considered for surgical resection for refractory disease, including a neck dissection if indicated. If the residual, persistent, or progressing disease is unresectable, then these patients should receive systemic therapy and/or RT as described for recurrent or persistent disease in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers. For patients with equivocal PET/CT scan results in the neck, a prospective study suggests that a repeat PET/CT scan 4 to 6 weeks later may help identify those patients who can be safely observed without surgery to the neck. These patients may also continue to be observed if the clinical examination is reassuring. **Long-Term Evaluation of Recurrent Disease** Recurrences in patients with H&N cancer tend to occur in the first 3 years following treatment, with more occurring earlier rather than later in this interval. There is little evidence to support imaging surveillance in the longterm (ie, >6 months following treatment) in patients who have negative imaging results, although delayed or late recurrences are more common in patients with HPV-related H&N cancer. Imaging should be prompted by new symptoms or physical examination findings. A metaanalysis including seven studies with 577 scans showed that FDG PET/CT showed high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (91%) values for detection of H&N cancer recurrence 12 months after treatment. However, a retrospective study including 1114 patients with H&N cancer showed that PET/CT scans conducted at 12 and 24 months after treatment completion become less equivocal with time. Further, among patients with negative 3-month scans, there were no significant differences in subsequent survival outcomes in patients whose recurrences were detected through PET/CT th ith li i ll d t t d -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers H&N cancer treatment can result in fibrosis and altered anatomy, which frequently leads to challenges in physical examination that may be assisted by follow-up imaging. Ultimately, the plan for long-term surveillance should consider tumor site, stage, prognostic factors, presence of symptoms, and changes based on clinical examination. Neck ultrasound (US), which is widely available, inexpensive, safe, and accurate, may be used to evaluate suspected nodal disease. For areas difficult to visualize by clinical examination (ie, due to anatomy or areas obscured by treatment change), routine annual imaging using the pretreatment imaging modality (usually CT or MRI) may be indicated. The impact of annual screening for lung metastasis or synchronous lung cancer in patients with a heavy smoking history is an area in need of investigation. Annual low-resolution chest CT should be considered for these patients. Many clinicians obtain a chest x-ray for lung screening, but this is not supported by strong evidence due to limited sensitivity(see NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at [www. NCCN. org). H&N RT treatment is associated with development of](http://www. nccn. org/) carotid artery stenosis, and RT dose to the carotid artery is associated with increased stroke risk. There is currently insufficient evidence indicating that routine screening with carotid US impacts outcomes, but data are evolving in this area. #### Treatment Principles **Head and Neck Surgery** All patients should be evaluated by an H&N surgical oncologist before treatment.

Use of robotic surgery is increasing in the United States. Postoperative hemorrhage is reported in (TORS). The risk of this complication can be reduced through use of appropriate surgical strategies (eg, transcervical arterial ligation). TORS is associated with favorable QOL and swallowing outcomes, although outcome may vary depending on baseline function, T stage, and adjuvant treatment. Evaluation, integration of therapy, assessment of resectability, principles for primary tumor resection, margins, surgical management of the neck and cranial nerves (VII, X-XII), management of recurrences, and principles for surveillance (including post-treatment neck evaluation) are discussed in the algorithm (see Principles of Surgery in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). **_Neck Dissection_** Historically, cervical lymph node (ie, neck) dissections have been classified as radical or modified radical procedures. The less radical procedures preserved the sternocleidomastoid muscle, jugular vein, spinal accessory nerve, or selective lymph node levels.

To remove the nodes most commonly involved with metastases from the oral cavity, a selective neck dissection is recommended that includes the nodes found above the omohyoid muscle (levels I-III and sometimes the superior parts of level IV). Similarly, to remove the nodes most commonly involved with metastases from the pharynx and larynx, a selective neck dissection is recommended that includes the nodes in levels II to IV and level V when appropriate. SCCHN with no clinical nodal involvement rarely presents with nodal metastasis beyond the confines of an appropriate selective neck dissection (<10% of the time). The chief role of selective neck dissections in these NCCN Guidelines is to determine which patients are candidates for possible adjuvant therapy (ie, systemic therapy/RT or RT), although selective neck dissections may be used as treatment when neck tumor burden is low. In general, patients undergoing selective neck dissection should not have clinical nodal disease; however, selective neck dissection may prevent morbidity as opposed to comprehensive neck dissection in patients with low-volume nodal disease, specifically in certain patients with N1-N2 disease. In patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes, radiation with or without chemotherapy should be considered and a decision should be made following multidisciplinary evaluation. In the NCCN Guidelines, patients with cervical node metastases who undergo operations with therapeutic intent are generally treated with cervical lymphadenectomy to remove all clinically positive nodes, other levels of the neck that may be at high risk for harboring metastasis, and non-lymphatic structures that are directly involved with cancer.

A combined analysis of data from the two trials has been done. The US Intergroup trial (RTOG 9501) randomly assigned patients with two or more involved nodes, positive margins, or extracapsular nodal spread of tumor to receive standard postoperative RT or the same RT plus cisplatin (100 mg/mevery 3 weeks for three doses).

The RTOG trial showed statistically significant improvement in locoregional control and DFS but not OS, whereas the EORTC trial found significant improvement in survival and the other outcome parameters. To better define risk, a combined analysis of prognostic factors and outcome from the RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931 trials was performed.

Because patients with these other adverse pathologic features were also included in the EORTC 22931 trial that showed a survival advantage for patients receiving cisplatin concurrently with postoperative RT compared to RT alone, the NCCN Panel added a recommendation to consider chemoradiation for these features. Performance status (PS) and physiologic reserve should be taken into consideration before recommending postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with high-risk pathology. In a randomized phase III trial from a single institution in India, cisplatin 30 mg/mweekly was compared to cisplatin 100 mg/mevery 3 weeks, when given concurrently with RT, in 300 patients with locally advanced SCCHN (93% in the adjuvant setting). Two-year locoregional control was superior in patients randomized to receive cisplatin once every 3 weeks (73. 1%), compared to patients randomized to receive weekly cisplatin (58. 5%) (HR, 1. 76; 95% CI, 1. 11-2. 79; P = . 014).

However, patients_ it may be difficult to detect local or regional recurrence due to severe acute toxicities, compared to patients randomized to receive weekly cisplatin (84. 6% vs. 71. 6%, respectively; P = . 006). The acute adverse events that were significantly more likely to have been reported in patients who received cisplatin once every 3 weeks were hyponatremia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphocytopenia (P < . 001 for all). A schedule using cisplatin at 50 mg intravenously (IV) weekly has also been shown to improve survival in the adjuvant setting in a randomized trial. In the randomized phase II RTOG-0234 trial, two regimens in patients with stage III and IV SCCHN were compared: 1) adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with cetuximab and docetaxel; and 2) adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with cetuximab and weekly cisplatin (N = 238). After a median follow-up of 4. 4 years, patients randomized to receive docetaxel experienced a 31% reduction in DFS failure rate (HR, 0. 69; 95% CI, 0. 50-0. 96; P = . 01), and a 44% reduction in mortality (HR, 0. 56; 95% CI, 0. 39-0. 82; P = . 001). The randomized phase II/III RTOG 1216 trial is continuing to investigate docetaxel/cetuximab with postoperative RT, compared to cisplatin or docetaxel with postoperative RT (NCT01810913). For patients with highrisk adverse pathologic features following surgery (ie, extranodal extension and/or positive margins) who are ineligible for platinum therapy, docetaxel/cetuximab is a category 2B option for postoperative systemic therapy/RT. **_Surgery for Relapsed/Refractory Disease_** Patients with advanced carcinoma (any T, N2-3) who undergo nonsurgical treatment, such as concurrent chemotherapy and RT, need very close follow-up both to evaluate for local recurrence and to assess for ipsilateral or contralateral neck recurrence (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients who do not have a complete clinical response to systemic therapy/RT, surgery is recommended as indicated. However, all panel members emphasized that it may be difficult to detect local or regional recurrence due to radiation-related tissue changes, and this may result in a delayed diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease. Panel members also emphasized the increased risk of complications when -----"

The patients undergoing neck dissection may develop complications related to delayed wound healing, skin necrosis, or carotid exposure. Laryngectomy may be indicated to obtain clear surgical margins or to prevent aspiration (eg, in patients with advanced oropharyngeal cancer). After laryngectomy for relapsed/refractory disease, patients may have a higher incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula, pharyngeal and stomal stenosis, and other wound complications. Flaps may be advantageous (either a free flap reconstruction of the laryngopharyngeal defect, or a myocutaneous flap to buttress the suture line if the pharynx can be closed primarily). **Head and Neck Radiation Therapy** RT for H&N cancers is increasingly complex. The availability and technical precision of techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) or intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) have each markedly increased. However, a thorough understanding of the natural history, anatomy, clinical circumstances, and imaging of specific disease conditions continues to guide the use of radiation as primary or adjuvant treatment. Principles regarding radiation prescriptions and techniques as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers are not all-inclusive. The planning and delivery of RT are rapidly evolving, and these technological advances provide much opportunity for variations and individualization in targeting and dose delivery, obviating traditional notions of standard fields and targets. Guidelines from the American College of Radiology describe basic technical specifications [(http://www. acr. org/Quality-Safety). Furthermore, major consensus](http://www. acr. org/Quality-Safety) approximately 60 Gy, but varies) may be used to cover volumes Flaps may be advantageous (either a free flap electively with low risk for microscopic spread. preferred;by 2 to 3 weeks. **_Radiation Doses_** concurrent systemic therapy will be used (see _Techniques_ the individual Principles of Radiation Therapy fields and targets. Guidelines from the American ). Furthermore, major consensus contouring guidelines for treatment of H&N cancers are available for reference, especially for patients who are treated without surgery. When radiation is given with definitive intent, the dosages prescribed for gross disease are fairly standard, usually in the range of 70 Gy (at approximately 2 Gy/fraction/day) for the following sites: lip, oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, glottic larynx, supraglottic larynx, occult primary, salivary gland tumors, and MM. A second dose (often approximately 60 Gy, but varies) may be used to cover volumes considered at the highest risk for microscopic spread, while a lower dose (often approximately 50 Gy, but varies) is used for volumes treated electively with low risk for microscopic spread. Although several palliative RT regimens are provided, no single regimen is preferred;specific regimens vary widely among NCCN Member Institutions. Any palliative RT regimen that might cause severe toxicities should be avoided. More hypofractionated regimens may be useful for patients with limited life expectancy, such as a few months. For example, a common version of the QUAD SHOT regimen consists of a dose of 44. 4 Gy, delivered in 12 fractions over three cycles, with each cycle separated by 2 to 3 weeks. **_Radiation Doses_** Selection of an exact radiation dose prescription and schedule of delivery depends on the primary tumor and neck node size, whether altered fractionation is used, and clinical circumstances, including whether concurrent systemic therapy will be used (see Principles of Radiation _Techniques in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers and see_ the individual Principles of Radiation Therapy for each primary site). The dose may need to be decreased if it is prescribed very close to adjacent organ at risk (eg, brain, cochlea, optic chiasm and nerves, spinal cord). In these cases, precise target definition and delineation is crucial, and ontreatment imaging should be used to ensure accurate radiation delivery.

When treating definitively using conventional fractionation, the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes (ie, high-risk sites) generally require a total of 66 Gy (2. 0-2. 2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2. 0 Gy/fraction). For areas considered highly sensitive to radiation, such as neural structures, some clinicians feel that the fractionation should be slightly modified (eg, <2. 0 Gy/fraction for at least some of the treatment) to minimize toxicity; in these cases, additional fractions can be added depending on clinical circumstances to increase the total physical dose. For instance, a hyperfractionated schedule allows gross disease to be prescribed a dose up to 81. 6 Gy (at 1. 2 Gy/fraction); hyperfractionation has been used for situations when tumor is abutting brain or optic structures. Care must be taken if prescribed doses exceed 72 Gy using conventional fractionation (2. 0 Gy/fraction), as this may lead to unacceptable rates of normal tissue injury; however, these data were collected in the era prior to advanced techniques such as IMRT or IMPT. In contrast, when using conventional fractionation, elective irradiation to low-risk and intermediate-risk sites is usually prescribed at 44 Gy (2. 0 Gy/fraction) to 63 Gy (1. 6-1. 8 Gy/fraction), depending on the estimated risk of tumor involvement, and on whether 3D conformal RT (3D-CRT) or IMRT is used. For 3D-CRT and sequential plans using IMRT, a range of 44-50 Gy (2. 0 Gy/fraction) is often suggested. For simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT, a range of doses from 54-63 Gy (1. 6-1. 8 Gy/fraction) can be used depending on the fractionation schedule and the risk of tumor involvement in the area where the dose is prescribed. In definitive RT, the delivery of six fractions per week is widely accepted, in a mildlyFor margins, depth or extent of invasion, multiple positive nodes, or high-risk features of extranodal extension and/or positive margins. weeks or less.

In definitive at least 1000 cGy per week to gross disease are recommended, accelerated schedule, especially if chemotherapy is not prescribed concurrently. Hypofractionation has been reported in some single institutional experiences and clinical trials, but a lack of high level randomized comparator data and concerns about the possibility of long-term late toxicity have limited its widespread adoption to date. Postoperative irradiation is recommended based on stage, histology, and surgical-pathologic findings. In general, postoperative RT is recommended for selected risk factors, including advanced T stage, close surgical margins, depth or extent of invasion, multiple positive nodes, or perineural/lymphovascular invasion. High doses of postoperative RT alone (eg, 66 Gy) and/or systemic therapy/RT are recommended for the high-risk features of extranodal extension and/or positive margins. Particularly for these high-risk cases, the preferred maximum elapsed time interval between surgical resection and the start of postoperative RT is 6 weeks or less. Postoperative radiation fractionation schedules tend to be similar (60-66 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction) whether or not systemic therapy is administered concurrently with postoperative RT. Hypofractionation may be considered for patients who are not good candidates for an extended course of several weeks of RT due to comorbidities, but these schedules have not been widely adopted as late effects are a particular concern in the postoperative population. **_Fractionation in RT Alone_** No single fractionation schedule has proven to be best for all tumors. Data strongly indicate that SCCHN can grow rapidly and may compensate for RT-induced cell loss through the mechanism of accelerated repopulation. Especially in the RT-alone setting, schedules delivering at least 1000 cGy per week to gross disease are recommended, although it is acknowledged that some tumors such as those of the of salivary gland may have slower cell kinetics.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers Two large randomized trials from Europe have reported improved locoregional control using altered fractionation as compared to conventional fractionation, when concurrent chemotherapy is not given. The EORTC protocol 22791 compared hyperfractionation (1. 15 Gy twice daily, or 80. 5 Gy over 7 weeks) with conventional fractionation (2 Gy once daily, or 70 Gy over 7 weeks) in the treatment of T2, T3, N0-1 oropharyngeal carcinoma excluding base of tongue primaries. At 5 years, a statistically significant increase in local control was observed in the hyperfractionation arm (38% vs. 56%; P = . 01) and no increase in late complications was observed. A long-term follow-up analysis has also shown a small survival advantage for hyperfractionation (P = . 05). Another EORTC protocol (22851) compared accelerated fractionation (1. 6 Gy 3 times daily, or 72 Gy over 5 weeks) with conventional fractionation (1. 8-2. 0 Gy once daily, or 70 Gy over 7-8 weeks) in various intermediate to advanced H&N cancers (excluding cancers of the hypopharynx). Patients in the accelerated fractionation arm had significantly better locoregional control at 5 years (P = . 02). Disease-specific survival (DSS) showed a trend in favor of the accelerated fractionation arm (P = . 06). However, acute and late toxicity were increased with acceleration, raising questions about the net advantages of accelerated fractionation. The RTOG reported the results of a four-arm, phase III, randomized clinical trial (RTOG 90-03) comparing hyperfractionation and two variants of accelerated fractionation versus standard fractionation. After 2 years of follow-up, both accelerated fractionation using a concomitant boost (AFX-C) and hyperfractionation were associated with improved locoregional control and DFS compared with standard fractionation.

Long-term follow-up confirmed a statistically significant improvement in locoregional control and OS with hyperfractionation compared to standard fractionation. The MARCH meta-analysis, including individual patient data from 15 randomized trials, analyzed the effect of hyperfractionated or accelerated RT on survival of patients with H&N cancers. Standard fractionation constituted the control arm in all of the trials in this meta-analysis. An absolute survival benefit for altered fractionation of 3. 4% at 5 years (HR, 0. 92; 95% CI, 0. 86-0. 97; P = . 003) was reported. This benefit, however, was limited to patients <60 years. Hyperfractionation was associated with a benefit of 8% after 5 years. An update to the MARCH metaanalysis, including data from 33 trials, continued to show a survival benefit of hyperfractionation, compared to standard fractionation (HR, 0. 83; 95% CI, 0. 74-0. 92; P < . 001), in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. Consensus on the optimal use of altered fractionation schedules using either concomitant boost or hyperfractionation for stage III or IV oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, and hypopharyngeal squamous cell cancers has not yet emerged among NCCN Member Institutions. Furthermore, as described below, using altered fractionation in conjunction with most concurrent systemic agents remains controversial. **_Fractionation in Concurrent Chemoradiation_** Panel members generally agree on conventionally fractionated radiation in combination with most concurrent systemic therapies in the definitive treatment setting. Most published studies have used conventional fractionation (at 2. 0 Gy/fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks) with single-agent high-dose cisplatin (given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m). Other fraction sizes (eg, 1. 8 Gy/fraction), other dosing schedules of cisplatin (eg, weekly), other single concurrent agents, concurrent multiagent systemic therapy, and altered fractionation schedules with concurrent systemic therapy have been evaluated alone or in combination. -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers chemotherapy are more efficacious than altered fractionation alone. However, conversely, the GORTEC 99-02 trial reported that altered fractionation did not improve outcomes when compared with conventional fractionation given with concurrent chemotherapy. Similarly, RTOG 0129 assessed accelerated fractionation with two cycles of concurrent cisplatin versus standard fractionation with three cycles of concurrent cisplatin. There was no significant difference in OS between the two arms, indicating that accelerated fractionation is not clearly more efficacious than conventional fractionation in the setting of concurrent chemotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiation increases acute toxicity compared to radiation alone, although an increase in late toxicity beyond that caused by RT alone is less clearly established. Altered fractionation and/or multiagent systemic therapy may further increase the toxicity burden. For any chemotherapeutic approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Chemoradiation should be performed by an experienced team and should include state-of-the-art supportive care. **_Radiation Techniques_** _IMRT_ Using contemporary computer-based planning and radiation delivery, the intensity of the radiation beam can be modulated to decrease doses to normal structures with minimal compromise of the doses to the cancer targets. Over the last 15 years, IMRT has displaced older techniques in the treatment of most H&N malignancies. IMRT is a highly advanced form of CRT permitting more precise cancer targeting while 70 Gy, 56 Gy, <26 Gy). indicating that accelerated fractionation is not clearly more toxicity can occur within large tumor targets due to the increasing volumes.

IMRT is now widely used in H&N cancers and is the predominant technique used at NCCN Member Institutions. RT, [188, 208-210] Over the last 15 years, IMRT has displaced older techniques particularly in T3-T4 tumors. IMRT is a highly reducing dose to normal tissues. [155, 196-199] _IMRT dose painting, also known as SIB, refers to the method of assigning_ different dose levels to different anatomic areas These areas are all simultaneously irradiated within the same treatment fraction but receive different prescribed doses (eg, 2. 0 Gy/fraction to gross tumor, 1. 6 Gy/fraction to neck at risk for microscopic tumor, <1. 0 Gy/fraction to parotid gland) resulting in different total doses to the different targets (eg, 70 Gy, 56 Gy, <26 Gy). Although dose painting has been used to improve the specificity of radiation delivery to tumors and thereby reduce unwanted radiation of uninvolved areas, hot spots associated with higher toxicity can occur within large tumor targets due to the increasing heterogeneity of dose distribution that occurs when prescribing to large volumes. An alternative to the dose painting or SIB approach is to create two plans, one irradiating widely to a low dose and one boosting specific areas to a higher dose; the boost plan may be delivered after completion of the initial plan, or the two plans may be delivered on the same day as separate fractions in twice-daily schemas (see Principles of _Radiation Techniques in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers). A meta-analysis including seven studies (n = 1049) showed no significant difference in survival outcomes or grade 3 or higher adverse events between SIB-IMRT and sequential boost-IMRT. IMRT is now widely used in H&N cancers and is the predominant technique used at NCCN Member Institutions. OS may be similar between patients treated with IMRT and those receiving conventional 3DRT, [188, 208-210] but both are superior to older 2D techniques. For example, a prospective Korean study showed that 3D and IMRT techniques were superior to 2D radiation for both PFS and OS in patients with NPC, and IMRT was associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis, particularly in T3-T4 tumors. However, IMRT has been clearly proven to reduce long-term toxicities. Xerostomia is a common long-term side effect of RT, which can be ameliorated with use of IMRT, drug therapy (eg, pilocarpine, cevimeline), salivary substitutes, and other novel approaches (eg, surgical relocation of submandibular gland).

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers radiotherapy techniques to IMRT. Numerous phase II and III studies show that IMRT decreases late toxicity (xerostomia) without compromising tumor control for nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, sinonasal, and other sites. Multiple randomized phase III trials support the clinical benefits of IMRT in H&N cancers with regard to the reduction in xerostomia. Pow et al evaluated treatment of early-stage NPC with conventional RT techniques versus with IMRT. The results showed a statistical improvement in salivary flow and in patient-reported QOL parameters. In the study by Kam et al, patients with NPC were randomly assigned to either IMRT or conventional 2D-RT. At 1 year after treatment, patients in the IMRT arm had significantly lower rates of clinician-rated severe xerostomia than patients in the 2D-RT arm (39. 3% vs. 82. 1%; P = . 001). Salivary flow rates were also higher with IMRT. The mean parotid dose was 32 Gy in the IMRT group and 62 Gy in the conventional group. Although a trend for improvement in patient-reported dry mouth was observed after IMRT, recovery was incomplete and there was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes between the two arms. The authors concluded that other salivary glands may also be important and merit protection. Finally, data from a phase III randomized trial in the United Kingdom (PARSPORT) indicate that IMRT decreases xerostomia when compared with conventional RT in patients with non-NPC cancers. In this trial, patients with T1-T4, N0-N3, M0 disease were treated to a total dose of 60 or 65 Gy in 30 fractions either with conventional RT (ie, parallel opposed 3D technique) or with IMRT; 80 patients with oropharyngeal and 14 patients with hypopharyngeal tumors were included.

No differences were seen in the rates of locoregional control or survival. A fourth trial, GORTEC 2004-01, showed that doseescalated IMRT (75 Gy in 35 fractions followed by a sequential boost of 25 Gy in 10 fractions), delivered concurrently with cisplatin, reduced xerostomia in patients with locally advanced SCCHN, compared to 3D-RT (70 Gy in 35 fractions followed by a sequential boost of 20 Gy in 10 fractions) delivered concurrently with cisplatin (23% vs. 63%, respectively, after 1 year, and 11% vs. 45%, respectively, after 3 years). Locoregional control did not significantly differ between the two study arms. IMRT likely reduces other long-term toxicities due to decreased radiation doses to structures such as pharyngeal constrictors, larynx, temporal lobes, mandible, auditory structures (including cochlea), and optic structures. [156, 193, 213, 218-223] IMRT is particularly useful in avoiding excess radiation of the optic pathway in patients with sinonasal malignancies. Retrospective analyses including 2993 patients who received RT for treatment of H&N cancer showed that patients who received IMRT had a shorter duration of feeding tube placement, compared to those who received 3D-RT (P = . 03). However, the randomized phase III COSTAR trial did not show that cochlear-sparing IMRT significantly reduced hearing loss in patients with parotid tumors, compared to 3D-CRT. One caveat is that additional care must be taken when using IMRT as it can create unanticipated toxicities to organs unexpectedly radiated in the beam path; a careful and informed examination of all organs potentially affected by these novel distributions of the radiation dose is mandatory. _Proton Beam Therapy_ At present, proton therapy is the predominant particle therapy under active clinical investigation in the United States. Proton therapy has been reported in the treatment of skull base tumors, oropharyngeal cancers, sinonasal malignancies, adenoid cystic carcinomas, and MMs. Proton therapy has typically been used to treat patients with the most challenging disease configurations, for which other RT options were not felt to be safe or of any benefit. -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers Data supporting the use of proton beam therapy (PBT) come mainly from nonrandomized institutional reports and a small number of systematic reviews. A systematic review and meta-analysis of non-comparative observation studies concluded that patients with malignant diseases of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses who received proton therapy appeared to have better outcomes than those receiving photon therapy. A review of proton therapy in patients with H&N cancers included 14 retrospective reviews and four prospective nonrandomized studies. The 2- to 5-year local control rates were as low as 17. 5% for T4 or recurrent paranasal sinus cancers and as high as 95% for other tumor types. In institutional series, the reported outcomes for proton therapy have included good locoregional control, freedom from distant metastasis, and acceptable toxicity. [228, 236, 239, 243-246] PBT may be associated with even greater normal tissue sparing without sacrificing target coverage, which is hypothesized to be associated with reduced toxicity compared to IMRT. This may be a particular advantage in cases of reirradiation. However, the planning and delivery of PBT continues to develop, and occasional fatal outcomes have been reported with proton therapy, including a small number of deaths secondary to brainstem injury in children. In general, clinicians have reported low rates of serious toxicities when using strict dose limits for proton therapy. However, these outcomes continue to be more fully documented. A case series including 122 patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer who were treated with PBT showed that 10. 6% developed osteoradionecrosis.

In general, clinicians have reported low rates of seriousHowever, achieved with PBT. _Brachytherapy_In patients intracranially or exhibit extensive perineural invasion, highly conformal dose distributions are crucial, and proton therapy may provide certain unique advantages. In patients with these types of tumors who are being treated with curative intent and/or have long life expectancies, PBT may offer the opportunity for lower late-onset toxicities. As described above, nonrandomized institutional reports and a small number of systematic reviews have shown that PBT is safe to use in a controlled setting. However, without high-quality prospective comparative data, it is premature to conclude that proton therapy has been established as superior to other modern radiation techniques such as IMRT, particularly with regard to tumor control. An accurate comparison of benefits to other RT options would ideally take place in the controlled setting of randomized clinical trials. Given the unique abilities of PBT to treat more difficult tumors, randomized trials may not be possible for some scenarios. In these cases, an alternative approach may be to develop prospectively maintained databases to raise the quality of institutional reports of clinical experiences. In cancers of the oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, paranasal sinus, and salivary glands, as well as MM, and unknown primary tumors of the H&N, the panel agrees that proton therapy should be considered when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy. The panel supports ongoing efforts to develop models to predict which patients would benefit the most from proton therapy and the development of higher-level and/or randomized data demonstrating greater efficacy or meaningful QOL gains potentially achieved with PBT. _Brachytherapy_ Brachytherapy is a uniquely conformal modality that is considered to be effective and safe when delivered by an experienced team of practitioners. Brachytherapy is now necessary less often because of improved local control and lower toxicities obtained with IMRT with or without systemic therapy. However, brachytherapy still has an important role in cancers of the lip and oral cavity (see Cancer of the Oral Cavity [Including Mucosal _Lip]: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and_ -----"

Brachytherapy may have a role in other select clinical scenarios such as reirradiation, as a boost for highly refractory disease or a positive surgical margin, or when extremely conformal radiation delivery is needed to a very well-defined tumor location; these are unique situations arising from challenging clinical circumstances and limited availability of head and neck brachytherapy expertise. _Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy_ Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is an advanced technique of external beam RT (EBRT) that delivers large ablative doses of radiation in a limited number of fractions. Advantages of SBRT include shorter treatment time, promising local control rates, and higher but acceptable toxicity depending on the specific location treated. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend SBRT routinely for treatment of H&N cancers, but the NCCN Panel acknowledges that it might be beneficial in the settings of reirradiation, palliation, or for older adults. SBRT has been reported the most extensively for reirradiation. Careful anticipation of toxicity is especially important in planning the delivery of this modality to a patient. SBRT has been delivered in conjunction with systemic therapy but caution is advised due to the relatively limited experience with combining these modalities. **_Follow-up After RT_** For patients whose cancer has been treated with RT, the recommended follow-up (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers) includes an assessment of thyroid function (ie, the thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] level should be determined every 6-12 months) and surveillance-oriented physical examination, symptom (NGS) genomic profiling for biomarker identification of actionable below under therapy/RT for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer is There is currently insufficient evidence described below under **_Primary Systemic Therapy with Concurrent RT_**SBRT has been reported the Randomized trials[134, 264-272] Careful anticipation of toxicity is in the NCCN Guidelines for cisplatin 100 mg/massessment and supportive care, and/or imaging as clinically warranted. Increased TSH levels have been detected in 20% to 25% of patients who have received neck irradiation. Changes in TSH may indicate thyroid gland dysfunction or hypopituitarism if the skull base was irradiated. **Systemic Therapy for Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma** **of the Head and Neck** Treatment that includes systemic therapy of H&N cancers is recommended for locoregionally advanced and metastatic disease. This section describes systemic therapy for locally advanced SCCHN with concurrent or sequential RT-based treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic profiling for biomarker identification of actionable alterations may be considered to guide treatment options. For detailed recommendations on combination and single-agent systemic therapy for metastatic (M1) disease (without surgery or RT treatment), see the section below under Very Advanced Head and Neck Cancers. Systemic therapy/RT for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer is described below under Cancer of the Nasopharynx. **_Primary Systemic Therapy with Concurrent RT_** Randomized trials[134, 264-272] and meta-analysesshowed significantly improved OS, DFS, and locoregional control when a systemic therapy and RT regimen (concomitant or, less commonly, sequential) was compared with RT alone for locally advanced disease. Limited data are available comparing the efficacy of different chemoradiotherapy regimens. High-dose cisplatin plus RT is the most studied effective systemic therapy/RT regimen and typically uses conventional fractionation or RT at 2. 0 Gy per fraction to 70 Gy administered over 7 weeks with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/mgiven every 3 weeks for up to three doses. Because of perceived lower toxicity, low-dose once-a-week cisplatin has been studied. A randomized phase III trial compared cisplatin 30 mg/mgiven once weekly to high-dose cisplatin, both given with RT to patients with locally advanced SCCHN. The primary endpoint was locoregional control. Most patients (93%) received study treatment in the adjuvant setting. Locoregional control was inferior in the cisplatin 30 mg/mweekly arm compared to the high-dose cisplatin arm. The 2-year locoregional -----"

Acute toxicities of grade 3 or greater were less common in the weekly arm compared to the high-dose cisplatin arm (71. 6% vs. 84. 6%; P = . 006). However, a systematic review and metaanalysis including six randomized studies with 554 patients with SCCHN showed that OS, PFS, and toxicity did not significantly differ between weekly cisplatin and high-dose cisplatin (both given with RT). Based on these data, high-dose cisplatin with RT is the preferred systemic therapy/RT regimen for locally advanced SCCHN. However, if the clinician has a patient-specific concern about the toxicity of high-dose cisplatin, a weekly low-dose cisplatin regimen (at 40 mg/m/week) may be substituted. The categories of evidence for other perceived better tolerated regimens are lower than for high-dose cisplatin. In the absence of confirmatory and mature prospective comparison trials, it is unclear whether weekly cisplatin is either less toxic or equally efficacious as high-dose cisplatin. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is common in SCCHN and is associated with poor survival outcomes. Bonner et al randomly assigned 424 patients with locally advanced stage III-IV squamous cell carcinomas of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx to receive definitive RT with or without cetuximab. Locoregional control and median OS (49 vs. 29. 3 months; P = . 03) were significantly improved in patients treated with RT and cetuximab compared to RT alone. Fiveyear OS was 45. 6% in patients treated with RT and cetuximab and 36. 4% in patients who received RT alone (HR, 0. 73; 95% CI, 0. 56-0. 95; P = . 018).

In the phase III GORTEC 2007-01 trial, cetuximab combined with carboplatin/5-FU and RT was compared to cetuximab and RT. Three-year PFS (52. 3% vs. 40. 5%, respectively; HR, 0. 73; 95% CI, 0. 57-0. 94; P = . 015) and locoregional failure (21. 6% vs. 38. 8%, respectively; HR, 0. 54; 95% CI, 0. 38-0. 76; P < . 001) rates were better with the combination regimen, but OS and distant metastases rates were not significantly improved. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis (73% vs. 61%, respectively; P = . 014) and hospitalization for toxicity (42% vs. 22%, respectively; P < . 001) were more prevalent in patients who received cetuximab combined with carboplatin/5-FU and RT. Cetuximab combined with chemoradiation is not recommended as treatment for SCCHN. In three randomized phase III trials, cetuximab and RT was compared to cisplatin and RT as a deintensification treatment strategy for HPV-positive locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer, but cetuximab and RT proved to be inferior to cisplatin (in terms of OS) and was not better tolerated. In the RTOG 1016 non-inferiority trial, 849 patients with locally advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer were randomized to receive accelerated IMRT with either cetuximab or cisplatin. After a median follow-up of 4. 5 years, the cetuximab arm did not meet the criterion for noninferiority (based on 5-year OS). Five-year OS was 77. 9% for the cetuximab arm and 84. 6% for the cisplatin arm. PFS and risk of locoregional failure were significantly worse in the cetuximab arm compared to the cisplatin arm (HR, 1. 72; 95% CI, 1. 29-2. 29; P < . 001 for PFS; HR, 2. 05; 95% CI, 1. 35-3. 10; P < . 001 for locoregional failure), with 5-year PFS and locoregional failure rates being 67. 3% and 17. 3% for the cetuximab arm, and 78. 4% and 9. 9% for the cisplatin arm, respectively. In the randomized phase III De-ESCALaTE HPV trial, cetuximab and RT was compared to cisplatin and RT in 334 patients with locally advanced p16positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers 12. 01 trial, 189 patients with intermediate-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer were randomized to receive 70 Gy RT with either weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m/week) or cetuximab. The 3-year failure-free survival was 93% in the RT/cisplatin arm and 80% in the RT/cetuximab arm (P = . 015). These three phase III trials demonstrated that cetuximab and RT was inferior to cisplatin and RT in patients with HPV-positive locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer. When concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommended for treatment of locoregionally advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, the panel asserts that high-dose cisplatin is the preferred systemic agent, although weekly cisplatin is also an option. An NRG trial is currently in progress for comparing high-dose cisplatin to weekly cisplatin in locally advanced SCCHN (NCT05050162). **_Induction Chemotherapy_** The role of induction chemotherapy in the management of locally advanced SCCHN has generated considerable discussion and debate within the NCCN Panel. The lack of consensus among NCCN Member Institutions despite the extensive discussion is illustrated by the category 3 recommendation (ie, major disagreement) for induction chemotherapy for the management of locoregionally advanced p16-negative and p16positive oropharyngeal cancer. However in other sites of disease (glottic and supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx), category 2A and 2B recommendations for induction chemotherapy are based on an update from the RTOG 91-11 trial. For selected patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers (with less than T4a in extent, for which total laryngectomy is indicated), induction chemotherapy--used as part of a larynx preservation strategy--is listed as a category 2A designation. When concurrent systemic therapy/RT is induction chemotherapy. distant metastases was noted with induction chemotherapy. chemotherapy and durable disease control with subsequent RT. among the procedures most feared by patients, the focus of initial studies of induction chemotherapy. advanced hypopharynx cancer--established the role of induction potential larynx preservation without compromise in OS (see _Larynx and Cancer of the Hypopharynx_ For selected patients with hypopharyngeal Panel members feel that induction chemotherapy should only be administered at sites with expertise in these regimens because of challenges associated with appropriate patient selection and management of treatment-related toxicities. Residual toxicity from induction chemotherapy may complicate the subsequent delivery of definitive RT or systemic therapy/RT. A summary of the data helps provide perspective on the NCCN Panel's recommendations. Most randomized trials comparing induction chemotherapy followed by RT and/or surgery to locoregional treatment alone did not show an improvement in OS with the incorporation of induction chemotherapy. However, in some studies, a lower rate of distant metastases was noted with induction chemotherapy. Also, a correlation was noted between favorable tumor response to induction chemotherapy and durable disease control with subsequent RT. Thus, the hypothesis was developed that induction chemotherapy could facilitate organ preservation, avoid morbid surgery, and improve QOL of patients although OS was not improved. Because total laryngectomy is among the procedures most feared by patients, larynx preservation was the focus of initial studies of induction chemotherapy. Two randomized studies--the Veterans Affairs (VA) Laryngeal Cancer Study Group trial in advanced larynx cancer and the EORTC trial in advanced hypopharynx cancer--established the role of induction cisplatin/5-FU followed by definitive RT in responding patients as an alternative treatment to total laryngectomy and postoperative RT, offering potential larynx preservation without compromise in OS (see Cancer of the _Larynx and Cancer of the Hypopharynx in this Discussion). Yet, even_ in this setting, the utilization of induction chemotherapy has decreased with time. Randomized trials and related meta-analyses indicated that concurrent systemic therapy/RT (with cisplatin being the best-studied agent) offered superior locoregional tumor control and OS compared to RT alone, [264, 267-269, 271, 273, 274, 276, 277] and shorter duration of therapy compared to induction therapy followed by radiation. Meta-analyses reported that concurrent systemic therapy/RT was more efficacious than an induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT strategy. In the larynx -----"

The concurrent cisplatin/RT arm had the highest larynx preservation rate (see _Cancer of the Larynx in this Discussion). Long-term follow-up of the_ 91-11 trial confirmed that concomitant systemic therapy/RT improved the larynx preservation rate and that induction chemotherapy was not superior to RT alone. However, OS did not differ among the three treatment arms. Nonetheless, interest in the role of induction chemotherapy endures for several reasons. First, advances in surgery, RT, and concurrent systemic therapy/RT have yielded improvements in locoregional control; thus, the role of distant metastases as a source of treatment failure has increased and induction chemotherapy allows greater drug delivery as a strategy to prevent this problem. Second, clinicians have increasing concern regarding the long-term morbidity of concurrent systemic therapy/RT, and thus have an interest in exploring alternative approaches that might have a more favorable long-term side effect profile. Finally, a more effective triplet induction chemotherapy regimen was identified compared to the standard cisplatin/5-FU used in the induction trials of the 1980s and 1990s, and analyzed in the related meta-analyses. Three phase III trials compared induction cisplatin plus 5-FU with or without the addition of a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) followed by the same locoregional treatment in both groups. Results showed significantly improved outcomes (response rates, DFS, or OS, depending on the trial) for patients in the three-drug induction group compared to those receiving two drugs (cisplatin plus 5-FU).

A randomized phase III trial in the larynx preservation setting similarly showed superior larynx preservation outcome with induction docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU (TPF) compared to cisplatin/5-FU. A meta-analysis including five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 1772) showed that the TPF induction chemotherapy regimen, compared to cisplatin plus 5-FU, was associated with reduced risk of death (HR, 0. 72; 95% CI, 0. 63-0. 83; P < . 001) and greater reductions in progression (HR, 0. 78; 95% CI, 0. 69-0. 87; P < . 001), locoregional failure (HR, 0. 79; 95% CI, 0. 66-0. 94; P = . 007), and distant failure (HR, 0. 63; 95% CI, 0. 45-0. 89; P = . 009). Whether adding induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation results in a clear advantage in OS continues to be unclear. Both the DeCIDE and the PARADIGM trials did not convincingly show a survival advantage with the incorporation of induction chemotherapy. In patients with stage III or IV SCCHN, a randomized phase II study compared induction TPF followed by concurrent cisplatin/5-FU with RT versus concurrent cisplatin/5-FU with RT alone. A higher radiologic complete response rate was reported with the incorporation of induction chemotherapy. Results from a larger follow-up study suggest a survival advantage. Other induction chemotherapy regimens have been evaluated in phase II trials. The ECOG-ACRIN trial (E2303) showed promising results in terms of primary site response and survival for cetuximab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as induction chemotherapy, followed by systemic therapy/RT with the same drug regimen in patients with stage III or IV SCCHN (N = 74), but the incremental benefit of induction chemotherapy requires validation using randomized design. Two phase II studies evaluated the feasibility of TPF with cetuximab followed by systemic therapy/RT or RT alone. The DeLOS-II trial showed that TPF followed by RT, with cetuximab administered throughout, was feasible but not superior to TPF and subsequent RT without cetuximab. An EORTC trial evaluating this induction regimen followed by systemic therapy/RT was stopped prematurely due to numerous serious adverse events.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers chemotherapy. Panel members agree that weekly carboplatin is a reasonable agent to use with concurrent RT. Intent-to-treat analyses from the randomized phase II TREMPLIN study showed no significant difference in larynx preservation rate at 3 months in patients with locally advanced larynx or hypopharynx cancers who received either cisplatin (95%) or cetuximab (93%) with concurrent RT following induction TPF. Although surgery for persistent disease was feasible only in patients who received cetuximab with RT following TPF, rate of treatment failure was lower in patients who received cisplatin with RT. Long-term results of this trial showed no significant differences between the study arms for 5-year OS, 5-year LRC, and 5-year laryngo-esophageal dysfunction-free survival. There were also no significant differences in toxicities, although late toxicities tended to be more common in the cetuximab arm, compared to the cisplatin arm (96. 1% vs. 86. 2% respectively; P = . 10). Results of the phase III GORTEC 2007-02 trial, in which 370 patients with bulky nodal disease (N2b, N2c, or N3) were randomized to receive carboplatin/5-FU with concurrent RT or TPF followed by cetuximab/RT, showed no significant differences between the study arms for survival outcomes and local control. There was a trend towards a lower rate of distant metastases in the TPF arm (HR, 0. 54; 95% CI, 0. 30-0. 99; P = . 05). The panel recommends cetuximab with concurrent RT following induction chemotherapy may also be used, but only in select circumstances such as in patients who are cisplatin-ineligible. Weekly cisplatin with RT following induction chemotherapy is a category 2B option, based on extrapolation. However, because of toxicity concerns, high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/mevery 21 days x 3 doses) is not recommended with RT after induction cisplatin-based chemotherapy. the gold standard by many NCCN Panel Members (see_Systemic Therapy_ Cancers). extensively studied) is more efficacious than cisplatin/5-FU.

Because of these uncertainties, enrollment of patients in appropriate clinical trials of induction chemotherapy is encouraged. Outside of a clinical trial, concurrent systemic therapy/RT--with high-dose cisplatin preferred--is considered the gold standard by many NCCN Panel Members (see Principles of _Systemic Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers). When induction chemotherapy is used, data show that the addition of a taxane to cisplatin/5-FU (of which TPF is the most extensively studied) is more efficacious than cisplatin/5-FU. Therefore, when used as induction chemotherapy for SCCHN, docetaxel with cisplatin/5-FU is a category 1 preferred recommendation. Paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU is also an option for induction chemotherapy. #### Principles of Supportive Care **Nutrition** The Principles of Nutrition section in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers outlines nutritional management and supportive care for patients with H&N cancers who are prone to weight loss, which can often be severe, as a result of treatment-related toxicity, disease, and health behaviors such as poor nutritional habits. Patients with H&N cancers are also at risk for dehydration. The multidisciplinary expertise of a registered dietitian and a speech-language/swallowing therapist should be utilized throughout the continuum of care. Patients who have had significant weight loss (5% body weight loss over 1 month, or 10% body weight loss over 6 months) need nutritional evaluation and close monitoring of their weight to prevent further weight loss. In addition, all patients should receive nutritional evaluation before and after treatment to assess the need for interventions (eg, enteral support via feeding tubes).

Patient referrals to occupational therapy to learn massage techniques (eg, lymphatic decompression therapy) or to be fitted for custom-made compression devices may be warranted. Patients are also at risk for problems with speech and/or swallowing. Treatment and/or the progression of their disease may cause deterioration in their ability to speak and/or swallow. Evaluation by a speechlanguage/swallowing therapist is needed before and after treatment to help mitigate potential problems. Patients are also at risk for dental problems (see Principles of Dental Evaluation and Management in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Long-term swallowing and dental dysfunction are particular risks that are worsened by multimodality therapy and require long-term specialized attention. Oral mucositis, or tissue damage, is common in patients treated with RT for H&N cancers, although use of advanced RT techniques (eg, IMRT) may decrease the incidence and duration of this damage. Oral mucositis causes pain in the mouth and when swallowing, which may affect the ability to eat and drink. Oral mucositis may be associated with breaks and/or delays in treatment, as well as hospitalization. Oral mucositis is more severe in patients receiving concurrent systemic therapy/RT. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology have published clinical practice guidelines for treatment of oral mucositis, although there are few high-quality studies in this area. In the randomized phase III Alliance A221304 trial, patients with H&N cancer who were treated with RT (N = 275) were randomized to receive a were randomized to receive gabapentin or usual care.

The reduction in mucositis pain during the first 4 hours of treatment was significantly greater in the patients who received the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash (P = 004) or the doxepin mouthwash (P = . 02), compared to the placebo. The practicality and effectiveness of the doxepin-based regimen through an entire course of RT is not established. Gabapentin is also under investigation for treatment of pain from oral mucositis. In a prospective randomized pilot study, patients with H&N cancer who were treated with chemoradiation (N = 79) were randomized to receive gabapentin or usual care. Patients randomized to receive gabapentin reported a greater reduction in pain, compared to patients randomized to receive usual care (P = . 004). A small retrospective study including patients with H&N cancer treated with RT or systemic therapy/RT showed that treatment with gabapentin for pain from oral mucositis is associated with a reduced need for narcotic pain medication and high doses of opioids. A single-institution study demonstrated that very-high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (2700 mg daily) also reduced the number of patients requiring narcotics. An unplanned secondary analysis of two consecutive prospective clinical trials showed that high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (3600 mg daily) was associated with greater time to first use of opioids, compared to 900 mg daily (P < . 001). The toxicity of large dosages should not be underestimated and was not adequately explored in these studies. Larger scale studies are awaited to fully assess the generalizability and toxicity of this dosing schedule. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study from China (N = 128), patients with RT-related neuropathic pain who received pregabalin reported greater pain relief (P = . 006 for 30% pain relief and P = . 003 for 50% pain relief) and greater pain intensity reduction (P = . 003) than patients who received a placebo. The panel recommends consideration of doxepin, diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, pregabalin (category 2B), or gabapentin for pain related to oral mucositis, as clinically indicated and as tolerated.

Reactive feeding tube placement should be considered if at least two of the following criteria are met: inability to maintain adequate intake (ie, <60% of estimated energy expenditure) for more than 10 days; greater than 5% weight loss in a single month; severe mucositis, odynophagia, dysphagia, or aspiration; or older age (ie, >60 years). A retrospective analysis including 100 patients treated with chemoradiation for advanced SCCHN showed that age >60 years was the most significant risk factor predicting need for enteral feeding (P = . 003). There is no consensus about whether prophylactic tube placement is appropriate. Advantages of prophylactic tube placement include reductions in hospitalizations and treatment-related weight loss, as well as improved QOL. However, this practice is also associated with disadvantages, such as longer dependence on feeding tubes and worse long-term functional outcomes, compared to a reactive approach. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for prophylactic tube placement, which should be strongly considered in high-risk patients (eg, those with severe pretreatment weight loss, ongoing dehydration or dysphagia, significant comorbidities, severe aspiration risk, anticipated swallowing issues). In patients with adequate swallowing function, care must be given with the help of speech and language pathologists to ensure that patients continue to swallow to prevent severe fibrosis and permanent feeding tube dependence (see Principles of Nutrition: _Management and Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and_ Neck Cancers). With swallowing therapy, adequate pain control, and access to IV fluids, feeding tubes can be avoided in most patients. The caries. [331, 335, 340, 354-358]A retrospective teeth.

[331, 335, 340, 354-358] In addition, RT to the salivary and oral soft tissues is also associated with bone demineralization and trismus of the masticatory muscles. Using IMRT and limiting the RT dose to the salivary glands and oral cavity have been shown to decrease xerostomia and damage to the teeth. [354, 355, 359-365] Dental/oral evaluation and management can help decrease dental caries and associated problems such as dentoalveolar infection and osteoradionecrosis. [335, 340, 358, 359, 365-374] The recommended dental/oral evaluations before, during, and after RT are described in detail in the algorithm and are summarized here. A dental/oral treatment plan needs to be implemented before RT and should include the following: 1) eliminating potential sources of infection; 2) if performing dental extractions, allowing adequate time for healing before RT; 3) treating active dental caries and periodontal disease; 4) treating oral candidiasis; and 5) educating patients about preventive strategies, including the elimination of sugar-based candies or gum for dry mouth prevention. Some of the general strategies to decrease oral and dental complications include: 1) decrease dry mouth (eg, by using salivary substitutes and stimulation and minimizing ingestion of alcohol and caffeinated products);2) reduce risk of dental caries (eg, by using topical fluoride);3) decrease dentoalveolar infection (eg, with frequent evaluations to detect and treat disease promptly); 4) prevent and address osteoradionecrosis; 5) decrease trismus of the masticatory muscles (eg, by using custom mouth-opening devices to maintain range of motion);and 6) have patient undergo evaluations during and after treatment to help minimize complications.

Major dental work such as extractions can be problematic for an irradiated mandible. Therefore, any planned procedures should be performed by dentists well-acquainted with this treatment setting and potential related morbidities, and in consultation with the treating radiation oncologist. During and after treatment, the goals of dental/oral management include: 1) addressing xerostomia; 2) preventing trismus; and 3) detecting and treating oral candidiasis. Additional goals after treatment include: 1) preventing and treating dental caries; 2) surveying the mouth for early signs of post-radiation osteonecrosis; and 3) preventing oral candidiasis. #### Cancer of the Oral Cavity (Including Mucosal Lip) The oral cavity includes the following subsites: buccal mucosa, upper and lower alveolar ridge, retromolar trigone, floor of the mouth, hard palate, and anterior two thirds of the tongue. The area has a rich lymphatic supply, and initial regional node dissemination to nodal groups at levels I to III. Although the risk of occult metastasis to level IV and V from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is low, the results of numerous studies are mixed, and, as a consequence, the role of surgical resection with an extended supraomohyoid neck dissection remains inconclusive. Regional node involvement at presentation is evident in approximately 30% of patients, but the risk varies according to subsite. The risk of lymph node metastases in these cancers is related to the location, size, and grade of the primary tumor. For example, primaries of the alveolar ridge and hard palate infrequently involve the neck, whereas occult neck extension, and nodal disease. Additional goals after treatment include: non-melanoma skin cancer. NCCN Guidelines for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer (available at www.

The incidence of lymph node metastases in cancer of the mucosal lip (especially in early-stage lower lip cancer) is historically low based on AJCC 7[th] edition stagingaveraging less than 10% with higher rates of nodal disease more commonly found in T3/4 disease or those with oral commissure involvement. Now that depth of invasion is being utilized for T staging in the AJCC 8[th] edition, the indications for neck dissection in T2 mucosal lip lesions will likely need to be broadened. Cancers of the lip mucosa are now staged as cancers of the oral cavity (see Table 1). The AJCC TNM staging system reflects tumor size, extension, and nodal disease. For the 8[th] edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, cancers of the external vermilion lip are staged as cutaneous carcinomas of the H&N, given the similarity of these cancers to non-melanoma skin cancer. For treatment of these cancers, see the NCCN Guidelines for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer (available at www. NCCN. org). **Workup** Imaging studies to evaluate mandibular involvement and regional lymph node disease and a careful dental evaluation are particularly important for staging (see Table 1) and planning therapy for oral cavity cancers in addition to a complete H&N examination, biopsy, and other appropriate studies (see Cancer of the Oral Cavity: Workup in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). In those patients likely to receive RT, either in the primary or adjuvant setting, pretreatment dental evaluation and care is critical to minimize the risk of subsequent osteoradionecrosis. Nutrition, speech, and swallowing evaluations are also recommended for selected at-risk patients (see Principles of Nutrition and Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). **Treatment** Treatment recommendations are based on clinical stage, medical status of the patient, anticipated functional and cosmetic results, and patient preference.

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers #### Cancer of the Larynx The larynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. The distribution of cancers is as follows: 30% to 35% in the supraglottic region, 60% to 65% in the glottic region, and 5% in the subglottic region. The incidence and pattern of metastatic spread to regional nodes vary with the primary region. The lymphatic drainage of the glottis is sparse and hoarseness is an early symptom, most glottic cancers are early stage at diagnosis. Thus, glottic cancer has an excellent cure rate of 80% to 90%. Nodal involvement adversely affects survival rates and is rare in T1-2 disease. In contrast, more than 50% of patients with supraglottic primaries present with spread to regional nodes because of an abundant lymphatic network that crosses the midline. Bilateral cervical metastases are not uncommon with early-stage supraglottic primaries. Thus, supraglottic cancer is often metastatic and higher stage at diagnosis. Subglottic cancer The evaluation of the patient to determine tumor stage is similar for glottic and supraglottic primaries (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of _the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers). Multidisciplinary consultation is frequently indicated for both sites because of the potential impact on voice quality, speech, and swallowing functions (see Principles of Nutrition: Management and _Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ The 2017 AJCC staging classification (8[th] edition) for laryngeal primary tumors is determined by the number of subsites involved, vocal cord but a common early-stage primaries rarely spread to regional nodes.

However, for other metastatic scenarios, a variety of palliative schedules may be used (see the algorithms for these schedules). For treatment volumes following induction chemotherapy, there are conflicting recommendations, but a common practice is to reduce the volumes receiving the highest dose according to shrinkage of tumor that respects anatomic boundaries. Reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent NPC should be conducted with careful attention to the previously delivered radiation plan and performed when complete surgical extirpation is not possible. Because of the anatomic location of NPC in proximity to the optic structures, brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, there can be high risk with reirradiation of injury to critical neural structures. Recommendations regarding NPC reirradiation have been published, and reports describe a variety of technical approaches including IMRT, SBRT, and brachytherapy. In general, a fractionated course of IMRT in combination with concurrent chemotherapy is the most frequently used approach when the intent remains curative. **Follow-up/Surveillance** Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see _Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers). Since the deep areas of the skull base are inaccessible to clinical examination, periodic cross-sectional imaging may be necessary. Likewise, inspection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa may be best accomplished with periodic endoscopy. The clinical benefit of blood EBV DNA monitoring is not yet clearly defined (see Epstein-Barr Virus, above), but it may be considered in centers with experience (category 2B). -----"

        "content": "## Head and Neck Cancers **Treatment** In the NCCN Guidelines, the treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer is divided into two categories: 1) tumors of the glottic larynx; or 2) tumors of the supraglottic larynx. For patients with carcinoma in situ of the larynx, recommended treatment options include: 1) endoscopic resection, which is preferred; or 2) RT. For early-stage glottic or supraglottic cancer, a systematic review published in 2009 showed that surgery or RT have similar effectiveness(see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers), although the quality of studies comparing the effectiveness of RT and surgery in early laryngeal cancer is low. A systematic review including 48 studies of patients with T2 glottic cancer specifically showed no difference in 5-year local control between transoral surgery (1156 patients; 77. 3%) and EBRT (3191 patients; 75. 8%). However, a meta-analysis including 11 studies showed that OS (P = . 04) and laryngeal preservation (P < . 001) were both better in patients who were treated with transoral laser microsurgery, compared to patients treated with RT. The choice of treatment modality depends on anticipated functional outcome, the patient's wishes, reliability of follow-up, and general medical condition. In patients with significant pulmonary comorbidity, total laryngectomy may be preferable over endoscopic or open partial laryngectomy. Partial laryngeal surgery should be carefully considered if adjuvant RT is likely. Consideration should be given to any suspicious lymphadenopathy and risk of metastatic nodal disease. Neck dissection should be performed as indicated when the primary site is treated surgically. In patients with T1-2 node-negative cancer of the supraglottic larynx, lymph node dissection is associated withlaryngectomy to achieve. managed with a combined modality approach (see _Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in_ _Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx_ A systematic review including 48 studies of patients with trial RTOG 91-11.

RT was uniform in all three arms (70 Gy/7 weeks, 2 The choice of treatment modalityIn patients with significant greater OS. T1-2 supraglottic cancers have a significant risk of occult nodal disease at presentation. Postoperative adjuvant treatment depends on the presence or absence of adverse pathologic features, such as margin status, nodal staging, and any extranodal extension. For cancer of the glottic larynx, subglottic extension is also considered an adverse pathologic feature. In the event of close or positive margins in organ preservation surgery, re-resection to negative margins may be considered. This may or may not require a total laryngectomy to achieve. Resectable, advanced-stage glottic and supraglottic primaries are usually managed with a combined modality approach (see Cancer of the Glottic _Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for_ Head and Neck Cancers). If laryngeal preservation is desired, concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommended, based on results from Intergroup trial RTOG 91-11. R91-11 was a successor trial to the VA trial and compared three non-surgical regimens: 1) induction cisplatin/5-FU followed by RT (control arm and identical to that in the VA trial); 2) concurrent RT and high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/mdays 1, 22, and 43; and 3) RT alone. RT was uniform in all three arms (70 Gy/7 weeks, 2 Gy/fraction), as was the option of surgery (including total laryngectomy) for relapsed/refractory disease in all arms. Patients with stage III and IV (M0) disease were eligible, excluding T1 primaries and high-volume T4 primaries (tumor extending >1 cm into the base of the tongue or tumor penetrating through cartilage). The key findings of the R91-11 trial were: 1) a statistically significant higher 2-year laryngeal preservation (local control) rate of 88% for concurrent RT with cisplatin, compared to 74% for induction chemotherapy and 69% for RT alone; 2) no significant difference in laryngeal preservation between induction and RT alone treatments; and 3) similar survival for all treatment groups. Based on these results, concurrent RT and systemic therapy (cisplatin preferred [category 1]) is a treatment option for achieving laryngeal preservation for T3, any N glottic and supraglottic cancers. Long-term follow-up (10 years) of R91-11 indicates that laryngeal preservation continues to be better (ie statistically -----"

OS was not statistically different for all treatment groups; there was more non-cancer-related mortality among patients treated with concurrent cisplatin/RT. Definitive RT (without systemic therapy) is an option for patients with T3, N0-1 disease who are medically unfit or refuse systemic therapy (see _Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the_ NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Surgery is also an option for this patient population. For those patients whose disease persists after systemic therapy/RT or RT, surgical therapy is indicated (see Post _Systemic Thterapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in Follow-up_ _Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ Induction chemotherapy with management based on response is an option for all but T1-2, N0 glottic and supraglottic cancers. Based on the longterm update of RTOG 91-11, induction chemotherapy is an option for patients who require (are amenable to) total laryngectomy. After a complete or partial response with induction chemotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer, RT alone is recommended (category 1);systemic therapy/RT is a category 2B recommendation after a partial response(see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the _Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _ For patients with glottic and supraglottic T4a tumors, the recommended treatment approach is total laryngectomy with possible hemi- or total thyroidectomy and appropriate neck dissection(s) followed by adjuvant treatment (RT or systemic therapy/RT)(see Cancer of the Glottic _Larynx, _ _Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx, and Principles of Surgery in the_ _Glottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy_ _Supraglottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy_ _Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the_ _Post_ in Follow-up in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). respectively; P larynx. older adults.

(see Cancer of the Glottic Tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare, and patients are often NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For selected patients with T4a tumors who decline surgery, the NCCN Panel recommends: 1) considering concurrent systemic therapy/RT; 2) clinical trials; or 3) induction chemotherapy with additional management based on response. **_Radiation Therapy Fractionation_** Fractionation for RT is discussed in the algorithm (see Cancer of the _Glottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy and Cancer of the_ _Supraglottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN_ Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients with T1, N0 disease of the glottic larynx, an accelerated dosing schedule of 63 Gy (2. 25 Gy/fraction) is preferred over conventional fractionation (66 Gy, 2. 0 Gy/fraction), based on results of a prospective randomized trial showing that this accelerated dosing schedule was associated with better 5-year local control, compared to a conventional dosing schedule (92% vs. 77%, respectively; P = . 004), in 180 patients with stage I cancer of the glottic larynx. A dosing schedule of 50-52 Gy (3. 12-3. 28 Gy/fraction) may also be considered for patients with comorbidities or travel logistics or who are older adults. **Follow-up/Surveillance** Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see _Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers). Serial endoscopy is recommended during follow-up examinations and may be supplemented with high-resolution, advanced radiologic imaging because of the scarring, edema, and fibrosis that occur in the laryngeal tissues and neck after high-dose RT. #### Paranasal Tumors (Maxillary and Ethmoid Sinus Tumors) Tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare, and patients are often asymptomatic until late in the course of their disease.

The treatment goal is usually cure for patients with newly diagnosed locoregional but unresectable disease. For recurrent disease, the goal is cure if surgery or radiation remains feasible, or palliation if the patient has received previous RT and the disease is unresectable. For patients with widely metastatic disease, the goal is palliation or prolongation of life. **Treatment** The treatment of patients with unresectable locoregional, persistent, recurrent, or metastatic H&N cancers is dictated by the patient's PS and intent of treatment (ie, palliative vs. curative). Patients with good PS may tolerate a wide range of treatment options, whereas patients with reduced PS cannot. **_Newly Diagnosed Locoregionally Advanced Disease_** In patients with a PS of 0 or 1, the recommended treatment of newly diagnosed, very advanced disease is concurrent systemic therapy/RT, with a large amount of phase III data supporting high-dose cisplatin as a category 1 preferred recommendation (see Primary Systemic Therapy with established in randomized studies. positive disease, as discussed above (see _Concurrent RT under Systemic Therapy_ mg/m. cisplatin with infusional 5-FU, and cisplatin/paclitaxel. for patients with a PS of 2-3 are described in the algorithm (see _T4b, N0-3 or Unresectable Nodal Disease or Unfit for Surgery_ NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).

However, an improvement in OS with the incorporation of induction chemotherapy, compared to proceeding directly to state-of-the-art concurrent systemic therapy/RT, has not been established in randomized studies. Cetuximab with concurrent RT is a category 2B option based on phase II and phase III data but is distinctly inferior to cisplatin with concurrent RT, particularly in patients with HPVpositive disease, as discussed above (see Primary Systemic Therapy with _Concurrent RT under Systemic Therapy in this Discussion). _ Other chemoradiation options that are also category 2B based on less panel consensus include carboplatin/paclitaxel and weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m. Category 2B chemoradiation options that the panel has deemed useful only in select circumstances are 5-FU/hydroxyurea, cisplatin with infusional 5-FU, and cisplatin/paclitaxel. Other options for patients with a PS of 2-3 are described in the algorithm (see Very _Advanced Head and Neck Cancer: Treatment of Newly Diagnosed (M0)_ _T4b, N0-3 or Unresectable Nodal Disease or Unfit for Surgery in the_ NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).

Randomized trials assessing a cisplatin-based combination regimen (cisplatin/5-FU) versus single-agent therapy with cisplatin, 5-FU, or methotrexate showed significantly higher response rates, but no difference in OS and greater toxicity for the combination regimen. Complete response is associated with longer survival and, although infrequent, has been reported more often with combination regimens. A phase III randomized trial (EXTREME) of 442 patients found that cetuximab plus cisplatin/5-FU or carboplatin/5-FU improved response rate (36% vs. 20%; P < . 001) and median survival compared to the standard chemotherapy doublet of platinum/5-FU in a patient population predominantly linked to tobacco and alcohol use (10. 1 vs. 7. 4 months; P = . 04). [620 ]A randomized phase III trial found no significant difference in survival when comparing cisplatin/5-FU and cisplatin/paclitaxel.

Median duration of response was greater in patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, compared to patients treated with the EXTREME regimen. It should be noted that Grade 3-5 toxicity was observed in 85% of patients receiving pembrolizumab/platinum/5-FU, and in 55% of patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. A post hoc analysis showed that the OS benefit of pembrolizumab with and without platinum/5-FU persisted at 4-year follow-up. The panel considers immunotherapy as the preferred first-line systemic therapy option for all patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic disease who have no surgical or radiotherapeutic option. Specifically, pembrolizumab alone (for patients with CPS >=1) or pembrolizumab/platinum/5-FU are both category 1 preferred first-line options based on the results of KEYNOTE-048; the combination regimen may be particularly suitable in patients with a PS of 0 or 1 and either a large burden of disease or nearing a clinical crisis. Other combination regimens recommended by the panel for treatment of metastatic SCCHN include: 1) cisplatin or carboplatin, plus 5-FU with cetuximab (category 1) ;2) cisplatin or carboplatin, plus a taxane;3) cisplatin with cetuximab;4) cisplatin with 5-FU;or 5) cetuximab with a platinum and a taxane. Extrapolating from Guigay et al, a taxane can be considered, when used in combination with pembrolizumab and a platinum, but pembrolizumab/platinum/paclitaxel is a category 2B option based on less panel consensus and less evidence than for use of docetaxel in this combination. Cetuximab combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab [category 2B] or nivolumab) is also an option for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN based on results from nonrandomized phase II trials.

A subset of these patients can be approached with curative intent local therapy, and the therapeutic options depend on several factors, including: type of prior therapy (surgery vs. radiation), interval between prior therapy and recurrence, desire for functional preservation, and patient PS. In general, surgery is recommended for resectable recurrent or persistent locoregional disease, in the absence of distant metastatic disease; adjuvant therapy depends on pathologic risk factors. Patients with resectable recurrent or persistent locoregional disease who have not previously been treated with RT may also be treated with concurrent systemic therapy/RT (high-dose cisplatin is the preferred [category 1] systemic agent). Combination systemic therapy followed by RT or systemic therapy/RT (category 2B) may be considered for cytoreduction or symptom control, followed by local therapy such as surgery as clinically indicated. Among patients with unresectable recurrence or persistence in a previously non-irradiated field, RT with concurrent systemic therapy is recommended, with the duration of RT and choice of systemic agent dependent on the PS. No randomized data exist that define a preferred systemic therapy/RT combination in this setting, although early-phase studies have explored carboplatin, PD-1 inhibitors, and cetuximab.

Advanced RT techniques should be used for reirradiation. A occurring in 16% of patients at 2 years. situations where patient or tumor factors render patients as poor candidates for curative-intent radiation or surgery, the treatment approach is the same as that for patients with metastatic disease; however, in the symptoms, re-irradiation with systemic therapy is increasingly feasible (see below). Locoregional treatment such as palliative radiation may be considered in the presence of distant metastasis with locoregional failure to alleviate tumor burden-related symptoms. RT fractionation for patients with recurrent or persistent disease is described in Very Advanced Head _and Neck Cancers: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN_ Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). _Reirradiation_ Reirradiation may be offered to patients with locally and/or regionally recurrent or persistent H&N cancer, using IMRT, PBT, or SBRT. A randomized phase III multicenter trial in France (N = 130) showed that reirradiation combined with systemic therapy in patients following a resected recurrence improves DFS, compared to patients receiving only surgery (HR, 1. 68; 95% CI, 1. 13-2. 50; P = . 01). However, the toxicity of this regimen was considerable, with grade 3 of 4 acute toxicity (mucositis/pharyngitis) in 28% of patients; however, results achieved using the older techniques in this study may not apply to the current day. SBRT with or without cetuximab following surgery for relapsed or refractory disease has been investigated in an institutional report (N = 28). Advanced RT techniques should be used for reirradiation. A retrospective review of 227 patients who were treated at an NCCN Member Institution showed that IMRT-based reirradiation of the H&N may be associated with local control and improved survival rates, but toxicity rates were considerable, with adverse events grade 3 or higher occurring in 16% of patients at 2 years. Use of concurrent systemic therapy may be associated with greater risk of toxicity. Rates for 1-year local control, distant control, DFS, and OS were 51%, 90%, 49%, and 64%, respectively, and adverse events grade 3 or higher were rare.

The decision to treat with reirradiation should take into account comorbidity, the toxicity of previous treatment methods, organ dysfunction, and the amount of time that has passed since previous treatment. Treatment planning should at a minimum take spinal cord and laryngeal lifetime dose limits into account so that the safest maximum dose is delivered. PBT may be used for reirradiation when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy. [555, 647-649] Retrospective studies show that PBT used for reirradiation may be associated with good outcomes (eg, 65%-84% OS, improved locoregional control, freedom from distant metastasis) and acceptable toxicity. However, in one retrospective study, three patients died (out of 60), possibly due to reirradiation-related effects. Dosing schedules that may be used for reirradiation are described in _Radiation Techniques in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck_ Cancers. Radiation volumes should usually include only volumes of known disease, to minimize the amount of tissue receiving high doses in previously irradiated regions. Therefore, prophylactic treatment (eg, elective nodal irradiation) is not routinely indicated. There are currently knowledge gaps regarding the appropriate use of irradiation, and patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials. _Disease That Has Progressed on or After Platinum Therapy_ For failure of platinum-based therapy, options are listed in the Guidelines (HR, 0. 70; 97. 73% CI, 0. 51-0. 96; Treatment planning should at a minimum take spinal received standard therapy (36. 0% vs. 16. 6%, respectively), and PBT may be used for reirradiation Retrospective studies show that PBT used for months, respectively; P However, in one retrospective study, threetumor PD-L1 expression level less than 1% ( was demonstrated for the nivolumab-treated patients (5. 7 vs. 5. 8 in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck results indicate that nivolumab prolongs survival in patients withThere are currentlyweeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks. (see Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancer: _Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic in the NCCN Guidelines for Head_ and Neck Cancers). NGS genomic profiling may be considered to identify biomarkers for applicable targeted therapies. Nivolumab was assessed in a phase III RCT including 361 patients with recurrent SCCHN whose disease had progressed within 6 months following platinum-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 5. 1 (range, 0-16. 8) months, the OS was significantly greater in patients given nivolumab, compared to patients given standard second-line single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab) (HR, 0. 70; 97. 73% CI, 0. 51-0. 96; P = . 01). One-year survival was also greater for patients who received nivolumab, relative to patients who received standard therapy (36. 0% vs. 16. 6%, respectively), and response rate was higher (13. 3% vs. 5. 8%, respectively), but median PFS was not significantly different between the two groups (2. 0 vs. 2. 3 months, respectively; P = . 32). In prespecified exploratory analyses, the OS benefit in patients treated with nivolumab appeared to be confined to those patients with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more (n = 149) (8. 7 vs. 4. 6 months; HR, 0. 55; 95% CI, 0. 36-0. 83). In patients with tumor PD-L1 expression level less than 1% (n = 111), no OS advantage was demonstrated for the nivolumab-treated patients (5. 7 vs. 5. 8 months; HR, 0. 89; 95% CI, 0. 54-1. 45). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13. 1% of patients who received nivolumab, compared to 35. 1% of patients who received standard therapy. These results indicate that nivolumab prolongs survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell H&N cancer that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy, relative to patients who receive standard single-agent systemic therapy. There are two FDA-approved dosing regimens for nivolumab for treatment of SCCHN: 240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks. Pembrolizumab was initially studied at a dose of 10 mg/kg given every 2 weeks in the SCCHN cohort of the KEYNOTE-012 trial, and clinical activity was identified. A lower, fixed-dose schedule using pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks was subsequently assessed in a phase 1b expansion cohort of 132 patients with recurrent or metastatic -----"

The diagram features key parts such as the **oral cavity**, depicted with elements like the **lip**, **buccal mucosa**, **floor of mouth**, and **oral tongue**. Additionally, the figure outlines several pharyngeal regions, including the **nasopharynx**, **oropharynx**, and **hypopharynx**, alongside anatomical structures such as the **larynx** and **esophagus**. Major anatomical landmarks like the **glottis** and **subglottis** are also included, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of potential sites affected by head and neck cancers.\n\n**Figure 2** presents a detailed representation of the **Level Designation for Cervical Lymphatics in the Right Neck**. This figure categorizes the cervical lymphatic regions by labeling them with Roman numerals. The labeled levels\u2014**I**, **II**, **III**, **IV**, and **V**\u2014are critical for understanding how lymphatic drainage works in relation to head and neck pathology, particularly for cancer staging and treatment planning. This differentiation is essential for medical professionals as it influences both diagnostic procedures and therapeutic approaches, highlighting the intersections of anatomy and oncology in comprehensive cancer care.\n\nTogether, these figures serve as valuable tools in the understanding of the complex anatomical structures and their relevance to cancer in the head and neck region, providing essential context for clinical practice and treatment strategies."
