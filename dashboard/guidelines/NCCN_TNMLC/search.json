NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2024 Head and Neck Cancers MS-44 complications were also less frequent in the hyperfractionation arm. It should be noted that, in this trial, hyperfractionation was not actually compared to standard fractionation, as the control arm of 60 Gy was delivered at 2.22 Gy/day, which is considered slightly hypofractionated for NPC. Nonetheless, because tolerability and late complications are a frequent concern associated with reirradiation, hyperfractionation to a lower total physical dose has high appeal as an attractive option for patients who are able to manage this rigorous twice-daily schedule. Recommendations regarding NPC reirradiation have been published, 567 and reports describe a variety of technical approaches including IMRT, SBRT, and brachytherapy. 568-570 In general, a fractionated course of IMRT in combination with concurrent chemotherapy is the most frequently used approach when the intent remains curative, with SBRT or more highly hypofractionated schedules (eg, ≥3 Gy/fraction) being more commonly used in cases of palliative intent. Follow-up/Surveillance Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Since the deep areas of the skull base are inaccessible to clinical examination, periodic cross-sectional imaging may be necessary. Likewise, inspection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa may be best accomplished with periodic endoscopy. The clinical benefit of plasma EBV DNA monitoring is not yet clearly defined (see Epstein-Barr Virus, above), but it may be considered in centers with experience (category 2B). Cancer of the Larynx The larynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. The distribution of cancers is as follows: 30% to 35% in the supraglottic region, 60% to 65% in the glottic region, and 5% in the subglottic region. The incidence and pattern of metastatic spread to regional nodes vary with the primary region. The lymphatic drainage of the glottis is sparse and early-stage primaries rarely spread to regional nodes. Because hoarseness is an early symptom, most glottic cancers are early stage at diagnosis. Thus, glottic cancer has an excellent cure rate of 80% to 90%. Nodal involvement adversely affects survival rates and is rare in T1–2 disease. In contrast, more than 50% of patients with supraglottic primaries present with spread to regional nodes because of an abundant lymphatic network that crosses the midline. Bilateral cervical metastases are not uncommon with early-stage supraglottic primaries. Thus, supraglottic cancer is often metastatic and higher stage at diagnosis. Subglottic cancer is not discussed, because it is uncommon. Workup and Staging The evaluation of the patient to determine tumor stage is similar for glottic and supraglottic primaries (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Multidisciplinary consultation is frequently indicated for both sites because of the potential impact on voice quality, speech, and swallowing functions (see Principles of Nutrition: Management and Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). The 2017 AJCC staging classification (8 th edition) for laryngeal primary tumors is determined by the number of subsites involved, vocal cord mobility, the presence of metastases, extranodal extension, and invasion of thyroid/cricoid cartilage (see Table 5). 391 Treatment In the NCCN Guidelines, the treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer is divided into two categories: 1) tumors of the glottic larynx; or 2) tumors of the supraglottic larynx. For patients with carcinoma in situ of the larynx, recommended treatment options include: 1) endoscopic resection, which is preferred; or 2) RT. 571,572 For early-stage glottic or supraglottic cancer, a systematic review Printed by Fredd Merc on 8/29/2024 4:45:54 AM.

NCCN Guidelines ® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2024 Head and Neck Cancers MS-45 published in 2009 showed that surgery or RT have similar effectiveness 573 (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers), although the quality of studies comparing the effectiveness of RT and surgery in early laryngeal cancer is low. 574 A systematic review including 48 studies of patients with T2 glottic cancer specifically showed no difference in 5-year local control between transoral surgery (1156 patients; 77.3%) and EBRT (3191 patients; 75.8%). 575 However, a meta-analysis including 11 studies showed that OS (P = .04) and laryngeal preservation (P < .001) were both better in patients who were treated with transoral laser microsurgery, compared to patients treated with RT. 576 The choice of treatment modality depends on anticipated functional outcome, the patient’s wishes, reliability of follow-up, and general medical condition. 577 In patients with significant pulmonary comorbidity, total laryngectomy may be preferable over endoscopic or open partial laryngectomy. Partial laryngeal surgery should be carefully considered if adjuvant RT is likely. Consideration should be given to any suspicious lymphadenopathy and risk of metastatic nodal disease. Neck dissection should be performed as indicated when the primary site is treated surgically. In patients with T1–2 node-negative cancer of the supraglottic larynx, lymph node dissection is associated with greater OS. 578 T1–2 supraglottic cancers have a significant risk of occult nodal disease at presentation. Postoperative adjuvant treatment depends on the presence or absence of adverse pathologic features, such as margin status, nodal staging, and any extranodal extension. For cancer of the glottic larynx, subglottic extension is also considered an adverse pathologic feature. In the event of close or positive margins in organ preservation surgery, re-resection to negative margins may be considered. This may or may not require a total laryngectomy to achieve. Resectable, advanced-stage glottic and supraglottic primaries are usually managed with a combined modality approach (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). If laryngeal preservation is desired, concurrent systemic therapy/RT is recommended, based on results from Intergroup trial RTOG 91-11. 288,294 R91-11 was a successor trial to the VA trial and compared three non-surgical regimens: 1) induction cisplatin/5-FU followed by RT (control arm and identical to that in the VA trial); 2) concurrent RT and high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 days 1, 22, and 43; and 3) RT alone. RT was uniform in all three arms (70 Gy/7 weeks, 2 Gy/fraction), as was the option of surgery (including total laryngectomy) for relapsed/refractory disease in all arms. Patients with stage III and IV (M0) disease were eligible, excluding T1 primaries and high-volume T4 primaries (tumor extending >1 cm into the base of the tongue or tumor penetrating through cartilage). The key findings of the R91-11 trial were: 1) a statistically significant higher 2-year laryngeal preservation (local control) rate of 88% for concurrent RT with cisplatin, compared to 74% for induction chemotherapy and 69% for RT alone; 2) no significant difference in laryngeal preservation between induction and RT alone treatments; and 3) similar survival for all treatment groups. Based on these results, concurrent RT and systemic therapy (cisplatin preferred [category 1]) is a treatment option for achieving laryngeal preservation for T3, any N glottic and supraglottic cancers. 294 Long-term follow-up (10 years) of R91-11 indicates that laryngeal preservation continues to be better (ie, statistically different) with concurrent cisplatin/RT when compared with either induction chemotherapy or RT alone. 288 OS was not statistically different for all treatment groups; there was more non–cancer-related mortality among patients treated with concurrent cisplatin/RT. Definitive RT (without systemic therapy) is an option for patients with T3, N0–1 disease who are medically unfit or refuse systemic therapy (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the Printed by Fredd Merc on 8/29/2024 4:45:54 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2024 Head and Neck Cancers MS-46 NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Surgery is also an option for this patient population. For those patients whose disease persists after systemic therapy/RT or RT, surgical therapy is indicated (see Post Systemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Induction chemotherapy with management based on response is an option for all but T1–2, N0 glottic and supraglottic cancers. Based on the long- term update of RTOG 91-11, induction chemotherapy is an option for patients who require (are amenable to) total laryngectomy. 288 After a complete or partial response with induction chemotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer, RT alone is recommended (category 1) 288 ; systemic therapy/RT is a category 2B recommendation after a partial response 302,303,579 (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients with glottic and supraglottic T4a tumors, the recommended treatment approach is total laryngectomy with possible hemi- or total thyroidectomy and appropriate neck dissection(s) followed by adjuvant treatment (RT or systemic therapy/RT) 580 (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx, Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx, and Principles of Surgery in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For selected patients with T4a tumors who decline surgery, the NCCN Panel recommends: 1) considering concurrent systemic therapy/RT; 2) clinical trials; or 3) induction chemotherapy with additional management based on response. 288,294 Radiation Therapy Fractionation Fractionation for RT is discussed in the algorithm (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients with T1, N0 disease of the glottic larynx, an accelerated dosing schedule of 63 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) is preferred over conventional fractionation (66 Gy, 2.0 Gy/fraction), based on results of a prospective randomized trial showing that this accelerated dosing schedule was associated with better 5-year local control, compared to a conventional dosing schedule (92% vs. 77%, respectively; P = .004), in 180 patients with stage I cancer of the glottic larynx. 164 A dosing schedule of 50–52 Gy (3.12–3.28 Gy/fraction) may also be considered for patients with comorbidities or travel logistics or who are older adults. 581 Follow-up/Surveillance Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Serial endoscopy is recommended during follow-up examinations and may be supplemented with high-resolution, advanced radiologic imaging because of the scarring, edema, and fibrosis that occur in the laryngeal tissues and neck after RT-based treatment. Paranasal Tumors (Maxillary and Ethmoid Sinus Tumors) Tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare, and patients are often asymptomatic until late in the course of their disease. Tumors of the maxillary sinus are more common than those of the ethmoid sinus or nasal cavity. 390 Workup is similar for ethmoid and maxillary sinus tumors (see Ethmoid Sinus Tumors and Maxillary Sinus Tumors in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Although the most common histology for these tumors is squamous cell carcinoma, a variety of histologies have been reported including intestinal type adenocarcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma (also known as olfactory neuroblastoma), minor salivary gland tumors, and undifferentiated carcinoma (eg, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma [SNUC], small cell carcinoma, midline NUT carcinoma, and sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma [SNEC]). 582-586 The defining features of esthesioneuroblastoma, Printed by Fredd Merc on 8/29/2024 4:45:54 AM.
