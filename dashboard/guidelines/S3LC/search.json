Special note 6 1.6. Special note Medicine is subject to a continuous development process, so that all information, particularly on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, can only ever correspond to the state of knowledge at the time the guideline was printed. The greatest possible care was taken with regard to the recommendations given for therapy and the selection and dosage of medication. Nevertheless, users are asked to consult the package inserts and technical information provided by the manufacturers for checking and to consult a specialist in case of doubt. In the general interest, any discrepancies should be reported to the OL editorial team. The user remains responsible for any diagnostic and therapeutic application, medication and dosage.

Objectives of the Oncology Guideline Programme The Association of Scientific Medical Societies, the German Cancer Society and the German Cancer Aid have set themselves the goal of jointly promoting and supporting the development, updating and use of scientifically based and practicable guidelines in oncology with the Oncology Guidelines Program (OL). The basis of this program is based on the medical and scientific findings of the professional societies and the DKG, the consensus of medical experts, users and patients, as well as on the AWMF's set of rules for the development of guidelines and the technical support and funding from the German Cancer Aid. In order to reflect the current state of medical knowledge and to take medical progress into account, guidelines must be regularly reviewed and updated. The application of the AWMF set of rules should be the basis for the development of high-quality oncology guidelines. Since guidelines are an important instrument of quality assurance and quality management in oncology, they should be systematically and sustainably integrated into everyday care. Active Implementation measures and evaluation programs are an important part of the promotion of the Oncology Guideline Program. The aim of the program is to create professional and medium-term financially secure conditions for the development and provision of high-quality guidelines in Germany. These high-quality guidelines not only serve the structured transfer of knowledge, but can also be used in the design of the structures of the © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","1.8.

Scope and purpose 2.1.1. Objectives and questions Laryngeal carcinoma is the third most common type of cancer in the head and neck region. It occurs primarily in men, who are affected 7 times more often than women. The peak age is between 50 and 70 years. In Germany, around 3,600 men and 500 women develop laryngeal carcinoma every year (www.rki.de). The majority of these are squamous cell carcinomas. Therapeutic results can be improved through early detection. Suitable methods for this, such as electronic chromoendoscopy (narrow band imaging) and other measures are presented in the guideline. In addition to the surgical treatment that is preferred today, conservative, organ- preserving procedures (radiochemotherapy) are also used as primary and adjuvant procedures. The decision on a treatment method that is tailored to the specific situation is still very different. The guideline is intended to help improve decision-making regarding the optimal treatment for individual cases (tumor stage, general condition and patient wishes) in the case of laryngeal carcinoma. The guideline is also intended to make decision-making when determining adjuvant therapy easier and to bring it closer to standardization. Target orientation of the guideline The guideline is intended to generally reflect the interdisciplinary nature of early detection, diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and aftercare. The guideline recommends evidence-based diagnostic and especially therapeutic procedures with the primary goal of organ preservation, but also highlights their limitations. Furthermore, measures for the early detection of laryngeal carcinoma have been developed. Another topic is functional rehabilitation after the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma. In addition, therapy recommendations for treating the lymphatic drainage pathways are given. Finally, concepts of palliative treatment are conveyed. The guideline also includes recommendations for the follow-up care of patients with laryngeal carcinoma. The guideline is intended to provide reliable support in achieving therapeutic goals and to help reduce the frequency of avoidable complications. The guideline is intended to provide patients and relatives with understandable and comprehensible information about the relevant therapy concepts. The recommendations of the guideline for optimal and standardized diagnosis, including appropriate measures for early detection, could be expected to enable patients with carcinoma of the larynx to receive treatment at an earlier stage and thus have a better prognosis. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","2.2. Basics of the methodology 16 The aim of situation-appropriate therapy is to improve functional outcomes and thus quality of life, as well as to reduce the toxicity of treatment. 2.1.2. Addressees The target patient group of this guideline are adults in whom there is a suspicion of the presence of a malignant tumor of the larynx due to functional disorders of voice production, breathing or swallowing and those in whom it has already been diagnosed or even treated. The target group of users are practitioners who work in inpatient or outpatient settings (especially ENT doctors and general practitioners). The following professional groups are addressed: • Doctors, especially ENT doctors, phoniatrists, radiation oncologists, haemato-oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, maxillofacial surgeons and general practitioners • Speech therapists, psychologists, social workers Other indirect recipients are dentists. In addition, the guideline and its patient guidelines are also aimed at patients, their relatives and interested laypeople. 2.1.3. Period of validity and update procedure The S3 guideline is valid until the next update, the period of validity is estimated at 5 years. Regular updates of the entire guideline are planned; if urgent changes are required, individual topics can be updated as part of amendments. Comments and suggestions for the update process are welcome and can be sent to the following address: larynx carcinoma@leitlinienprogramm- onkologie.de 2.2. Basics of the methodology The methodological approach to the preparation of the guideline is set out in the guideline report. This is available on the Internet, for example on the website of the Oncology Guideline Program (http:// www.leitlinienprogramm- onkologie.de/ leitlinien/ larynxkrebs/ ) and the AWMF pages (http:// www.awmf.org/ ) is freely available. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","2.2.

Basics of the methodology 19 2.2.2. Scheme of recommendation grading The methodology of the Oncology Guideline Program provides for the award of recommendation grades (seeTable 5 ) by the guideline authors as part of a formal consensus process. Accordingly, nominal group processes moderated by AWMF-certified guideline consultants or structured consensus conferences were conducted [1]. As part of these processes, the recommendations were approved by the voting representatives (see chapter 1.9.2 ) formally voted on. The results of the respective votes (consensus strength) are shown according to the categories inTable 6 assigned to the recommendations. Table 5: Scheme of recommendation grading Recommendation level Description Expression A Strong recommendation should/should not B Recommendation should/should not 0 Recommendation open can be waived Table 6: Strength of consensus Consensus strength Percent approval Strong consensus > 95% of eligible voters consensus > 75 – 95 % of eligible voters Majority approval > 50 – 75 % of those entitled to vote Dissent < 50% of eligible voters The decision criteria for determining the levels of recommendation are explained in the guideline report on this guideline. 2.2.3. Statements Statements are explanations or explanations of specific facts or questions without an immediate call for action. They are adopted in accordance with the procedure for recommendations within the framework of a formal consensus process and can be based either on study results or on expert opinions. 2.2.4. Expert consensus (EC) Statements/recommendations that were adopted by the guideline group on the basis of expert consensus (not on the basis of a systematic search or guideline adaptation) are identified as such with the grading “EK”. No symbols or letters were used to gradate the expert consensus; the strength of the expert consensus is determined by the wording used (should/can/should be) according to the grading inTable 5 . © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","2.2. Basics of the methodology 20 2.2.5. Independence and explanation of possible Conflicts of interest The German Cancer Aid provided the financial resources within the framework of the Oncology Guidelines Program (OL). These funds were used for personnel costs, office supplies, literature procurement and the two consensus conferences (room rental, technology, catering, moderator fees, travel expenses for participants). Travel expenses were reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Act and the guidelines used by the DKG. The guideline was drawn up with editorial independence from the funding organization. Funds from the German Cancer Aid were available for the evidence analysis and methodological support. The guideline coordinators and all other experts involved received no remuneration for their guideline work. At the beginning of the guideline process, all members submitted a written declaration of any conflicts of interest that may exist. The AWMF form was used (the mandate holders were questioned according to the categories of the AWMF form on expert/advisory activities, third- party funded research, patents, schools/scientific interests, personal relationships/ownership of business shares and membership of relevant organizations). During the course of the guideline's development, individual mandate holders submitted an update. At the beginning of both consensus conferences, the possibility of a conflict of interest was discussed in plenary on the basis of the individual declarations. The query on expert/advisory activities was specified for the areas of the oropharynx and larynx, and the query on lectures was specified for the area of the larynx. The conflict of interest declaration of the guideline coordinator was forwarded to the OL Office for review, the others were reviewed by the guideline coordinator. At the first consensus meeting on July 14, 2016 in Berlin, it was determined that mandate holders who have led studies on specific topics of laryngeal carcinoma should not vote on the corresponding statements and recommendations: They could, however, provide documents and further information and participate in the discussion. Third-party funding from industry and advisory boards should be stated. The company name (third-party funding) should be mentioned. When providing information on third-party funding, it should be made clear which company it came from and what it was spent on. People who have received third-party funding from industry that is related to laryngeal carcinoma or who belong to an advisory board that is associated with this indication should not vote on the statements and recommendations affected by this. The voting rules were implemented in the consensus conferences as agreed: Prof. Dr. Fietkau abstained from voting on the topics of supportive nutritional therapies and chemotherapy for relapses due to his research activities. Prof. Budach and Mr. Fietkau abstained from questions relating to the active ingredient cetuximab. A total of 5 of the experts present abstained from voting on the recommendation on PD-1 inhibitors due to conflicts of interest. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.1. Prevalence/ Incidence 21 3. Epidemiology 3.1. Prevalence/ Incidence 3.1. Consensus-based statement EEC The estimated crude incidence rate for laryngeal cancer for 2016 is 8.0 per 100,000 in men and 1.4 per 100,000 in women. Since 2000, the incidence of laryngeal cancer has decreased significantly in younger men. A slight decrease has also been observed in older men. During the same period, the incidence rate in women has remained constant. The mortality rates have decreased in both sexes. The average age of onset is 64 years for women and 66 years for men. Strong consensus: 95% Laryngeal carcinoma is the third most common malignant tumor in the head and neck region after oral cavity and pharyngeal carcinoma. The age-standardized incidence rate in Germany in 2012 was 5.4 per 100,000 for men and 1.0 per 100,000 for women. Currently, around 3100 men and 490 women are newly diagnosed with laryngeal carcinoma each year [2]. The gender ratio in Germany is approximately 7:1 [3]. One in 170 men will develop laryngeal cancer during their lifetime, whereas only one in 1,100 women will develop it [4]. The 5-year prevalence in 2012 was 11,400 cases for men and 1,800 cases for women [4]. In international comparison, the incidence and mortality rate in Germany is behind countries such as Poland and France, but ahead of countries such as Finland and Sweden. The incidence rate depends in particular on the risk factor smoking (see chapter3.2 ). In the European Union, mortality remained almost constant between 1980 and 1991, but since 1991 there has been an annual decline in mortality of 3.3% per year [5, 6]. Age-standardized mortality in the EU decreased in one decade from 4.7 (1990-91) to 2.5 (2010-11) [5]. In the USA, the incidence and mortality for laryngeal cancer have also decreased in the last 2 decades. According to estimates by GLOBOCAN, more than 150,000 new cases of laryngeal carcinoma occurred in men and more than 20,000 in women worldwide in 2015. In men, laryngeal carcinoma is the 14th most common malignant tumor worldwide [7]. The global incidence of laryngeal carcinoma is 5.1/100,000 for men and 0.6/100,000 for women [8]. The frequency of laryngeal carcinoma in the defined sublocations is 17-23% for supraglottic carcinomas, 75-80% for glottic carcinomas and 2-5% for subglottic carcinomas [3]. In a recent analysis of German cancer registry data, glottic carcinomas accounted for 50% of newly occurring laryngeal carcinomas in men and 33% in women [9]. At the initial diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma, the T-category T1 was 42% in men, T2 was 21%, T3 was 20% and T4 was 17%, and in women the T-category T1 was 38%. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.2. Risk factors 22 T2 was 24%, T3 was 23% and T4 was 15% [4]. The mortality rate (age-standardized rate per 100,000 inhabitants) in Germany in 2012 was 2.1 for men and 0.3 for women. The 5-year survival rate in the USA was 60.7% from 2006 to 2011 and has not improved in the last 40 years [10]. Overall, the relative 5-year survival rate for laryngeal carcinoma in Germany is 62% for men and 65% for women [4]. 3.2. Risk factors 3.2. Consensus-based statement EEC Tobacco consumption is a major risk factor for the development of laryngeal cancer. Strong consensus: 100% 3.3. Consensus-based statement EEC Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for the development of laryngeal cancer. Strong consensus: 96% 3.4. Consensus-based statement EEC Laryngeal carcinoma is recognized as an occupational disease in cases of exposure to asbestos, intensive and long-term exposure to aerosols containing sulfuric acid and ionizing radiation, e.g. from uranium. Other occupational factors, such as cement dust, wood dust and emissions from political aromatics, were found to be less important in meta-analyses. Strong consensus: 100% 3.5. Consensus-based recommendation EEC The recipients of this guideline should advise their patients to stop smoking and to reduce alcohol consumption as much as possible. Strong consensus: 100% Epidemiological risk factors The main risk factors for the occurrence of laryngeal carcinoma are chronic tobacco and alcohol abuse, especially in combination. In the case of chronic tobacco or alcohol abuse, the risk of developing the disease is up to 6-fold higher, and in the case of a combination of both risk factors, the risk is up to 30-fold higher [11-13]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.2. Risk factors 23 The influence of alcohol as a risk factor depends on the location. In particular, supraglottic carcinomas arise from combined consumption, while glottic carcinomas are more likely to be purely tobacco-associated [14]. In addition to these two known noxious substances that can lead to laryngeal carcinoma, there are also occupational causes. For example, laryngeal carcinoma caused by asbestos is recognized as an occupational disease. Ionizing radiation, e.g. from uranium, has also been recognized in the past as the cause of carcinoma in less than 100 cases under BK 2402. A case-control study also described a 2.67-fold increased risk of laryngeal carcinoma after occupational exposure to coal and tar products, which was adjusted for smoking and alcohol [15]. Inhalation of aerosols containing sulfuric acid with an exposure level of at least 0.2 mg/ m3 and full-shift exposure for more than 5 years can lead to laryngeal carcinoma (BK No. 1319) [16]. When exposed to sulfuric acid aerosols, the risk increases equally for smokers and non-smokers [17]. Other occupational factors that have been highlighted in the literature, such as cement dust, wood dust and emissions from volatile aromatics, have been shown to be less significant in meta-analyses [18]. Nevertheless, it can be postulated that fewer cases of laryngeal cancer are observed in emission-free occupational environments than in environments exposed to dust and emissions. Infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV16, is another risk factor for laryngeal carcinoma, although it is significantly less significant than oropharyngeal carcinoma. In rare cases, laryngeal carcinoma can also develop after long-term infection with the low-risk types HPV6 or HPV11 [19, 20]. While earlier studies assumed a rate of 24% HPV- positive laryngeal carcinomas [21], current studies show much lower rates with 5.7% HPV- positive laryngeal carcinomas [22]. However, the sole detection of HPV DNA in the carcinoma is not sufficient to prove the causal role of HPV. Such proof can be achieved by additionally detecting the mRNA of the viral oncoproteins E6 or E7. In contrast to oropharyngeal carcinoma, the sole detection of p16(INK4A) protein expression is not a good surrogate marker for an HPV-associated tumor in laryngeal carcinoma [23, 24]. Under the premise of detecting viral DNA in combination with HPV E6 mRNA, only 3.1% of laryngeal carcinomas were HPV-associated in a recent study [22]. In a meta-analysis that included 2739 patients with laryngeal carcinomas, HPV DNA was detected in 22.1% of cases, but E6/E7 mRNA was only detected in 8.6% of cases. Only in the latter cases can causal carcinogenesis by HPV be assumed. In a study from Germany, a causal role of HPV16 in laryngeal carcinoma could also only be demonstrated in <5% of cases [25]. However, the serological detection of antibodies against HPV16 is still associated with an increase in the risk of laryngeal carcinoma by a factor of 2.4 [26]. Recently, it was shown that for patients with antibodies against HPV16-E6, the risk of laryngeal carcinoma is increased by 4.18 and for those with antibodies against HPV16-E6 & E7, the risk is increased by 30.84. However, for comparison, the risk of The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is already 132-fold increased when HPV16-E6 antibodies are detected. The risk of laryngeal cancer is also increased when antibodies against HPV6 are detected (3.25-fold) [27]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.2. Risk factors 24 In addition to the factors mentioned, an unbalanced diet, including excessive consumption of meat or fried food, is also controversially discussed as a contributing factor to the development of laryngeal carcinoma [28-32]. Conversely, it has been shown that with a balanced diet, e.g. a \"Mediterranean\" diet, the risk of developing laryngeal carcinoma can be more than halved, adjusted for nicotine consumption and BMI [33]. The key protective elements of such a diet are citrus fruits, vegetables - especially fresh tomatoes, olive oil and fish oils [34-37]. Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids to more than 1g per week also reduces the risk of laryngeal carcinoma [38]. Overall, however, the latter nutritional factors clearly take a back seat to the risk measured for tobacco and alcohol. In addition, there is no evidence to support the assumption that genetically predisposing factors can also promote the development of carcinomas in the head and neck region; familial clustering is known. There are currently no screening methods available to identify these risk factors [39-43]. For histopathological precursor lesions and associated risk assessments, see below. 3.2.1. Histological precursor lesions as risk factors 3.6. Consensus-based recommendation EEC If there is clinical suspicion of a possible precursor lesion to laryngeal carcinoma (eg leukoplakia, erythroplakia, papillomatous mucosal changes), a histological examination should be performed, preferably as an excisional biopsy. In the case of moderate or severe dysplasia/squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, regular check-ups should be carried out. Strong consensus: 100% To improve readability, the term precursor lesion is used consistently in the following text instead of the very different terms that are often used synonymously (precancerous lesion, potentially malignant lesion, precursor lesion, etc.). Whitish mucosal lesions in the larynx, which are found primarily on the vocal cords, are referred to as “simple” leukoplakia if there is a corresponding histological picture of mucosal acanthosis and hyper-/parakeratosis (preferably verified by excisional biopsy) and must be clinically and morphologically differentiated from inflammatory changes that can also induce whitish mucosal alterations in the larynx. The detection of histomorphologically confirmed leukoplakia is associated with an increased risk of developing dysplasia (see below) or manifest laryngeal carcinoma [44]. Macroscopically, mucosal changes that appear whitish but also reddish (=erythroplakia) or papillomatous can, however, histologically also already appear as genuine, in the true sense of the word, undoubtedly neoplastic precursor lesions [45, 46]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.2. Risk factors 25 The current WHO classification now uses the term dysplasia for this group of lesions again [47, 48]. A distinction is made between “low-grade” and “high-grade” dysplasia; carcinoma in situ is a particularly pronounced form of “high-grade” dysplasia and can also be subsumed under this. In German-speaking countries, the somewhat more differentiated three-stage system of low, moderate and high-grade dysplasia is established. Low dysplasia corresponds to a “low grade” lesion, moderate and high-grade dysplasia corresponds to a “high grade” lesion; this classification is also confirmed by data on progression rates [46]. Unfortunately, in the case of head and neck cancer, the concept of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIN), which is better in the opinion of the guideline authors and was also promoted in the previous version of the WHO classification and widely used in Germany [49], has not yet been finally adopted due to international disputes over the terminology and has now been \"replaced\" by the old term dysplasia [47, 48]. However, in the opinion of the guideline authors, the term intraepithelial neoplasia is generally preferable to the term epithelial dysplasia, since the neoplastic character of the lesions is thus also reflected in the nomenclature. According to the SIN classification, a distinction is made between low-grade, moderate-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIN) in the laryngeal region [50-52]. In this nomenclature, low-grade dysplasia/squamous intraepithelial neoplasia corresponds to grade SIN I, moderate-grade dysplasia/squamous intraepithelial neoplasia to grade SIN II and high- grade dysplasia/squamous intraepithelial neoplasia to grade SIN III [52], which also includes carcinoma in situ (see above). The authors are of the opinion that the SIN classification can still be used analogously to the three-stage dysplasia grading; it seems advisable to specify both terms in the sense of dysplasia/squamous intraepithelial neoplasia including severity (mild/moderate/severe). In addition, for international harmonization and to enable interpretability of future study data, an assessment should be given as to whether this is a \"low grade\" or \"high grade\" lesion according to the WHO. The optional separation of the high-grade category into “high-grade dysplasia” and “carcinoma in situ”, which is still proposed in the current WHO, also appears confusing, not useful, not sufficiently supported by data and is not reflected in other organ systems. In the authors’ opinion, it should therefore not be used for the time being. Although the risk of developing an invasive carcinoma increases with higher-grade precursor lesions – regardless of the grading system used – the corresponding figures for quantifying the risk vary greatly between individual studies [46]. From a clinical point of view, leukoplakia must be closely monitored, if necessary also by repeated histological or cytological examinations for possible Transformation tendencies into dysplasia/intraepithelial neoplasia should be monitored, initially an excisional biopsy is indicated wherever possible. In the case of dysplastic lesions, complete removal is recommended. In principle, any lesion that has persisted for more than 3-4 weeks Mucosal changes are suspected of being tumors and must be clarified. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","3.2. Risk factors 26 In this context, reference should also be made to the guideline on the diagnosis and management of oral mucosal changes, in particular precursor lesions of oral squamous cell carcinoma in dentistry, oral and maxillofacial medicine, which, however, mainly refers to Oral cavity lesions [53]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.1. Prognostic and predictive factors 27 4. Prognosis/Prediction 4.1. Prognostic and predictive factors 4.1. Consensus-based statement EEC The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma depends essentially on the location, TNM classification and R status. Furthermore, the differentiation and the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion (lymphangiosis carcinomatosa) are relevant to the prognosis. Glottic carcinomas have the best prognosis, subglottic carcinomas the worst Consensus: 95% Established clinical-pathological prognostic factors Currently, some clinical and pathological characteristics of the primary tumor serve as prognostic factors relevant to therapy in laryngeal carcinoma (see also chapter7 ). The main point here is that the general prognostic factors that apply to all head and neck carcinomas also apply to laryngeal carcinoma. The main therapy-relevant prognostic factor in laryngeal carcinoma is - as in almost all epithelial head/neck tumors - the established TNM stage, which can be determined clinically or pathologically (on the resected specimen) (see below) [47]. The most important locoregional pathological factors in this context are the presence of lymph node metastases, their size and the evidence of growth beyond the capsule. Furthermore, local tumor spread (T) as well as lymphatic invasion (lymphangiosis carcinomatosa) (L) and venous invasion (V) in the resected specimen of the primary tumor are other relevant prognostic factors. Tumor differentiation (G) also has a certain prognostic significance - albeit limited and still partly controversial. Another important prognostic factor is the tumor location. Vocal cord carcinoma has the best prognosis due to its early symptoms and the associated low probability of metastasis. However, the prognosis worsens if the vocal cord is fixed. Supraglottic carcinoma has a significantly worse prognosis than glottic carcinoma because it leads to lymph node metastases relatively early. Of particular prognostic importance in supraglottic carcinoma is the infiltration of the preepiglottic space, which significantly worsens the prognosis [54, 55]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.1. Prognostic and predictive factors 28 4.1.1. Other prognostic factors 4.2. Consensus-based statement EEC In contrast to oropharyngeal carcinoma, HPV status does not play a role as a prognostic factor in laryngeal carcinoma Strong consensus: 100% The detection of human papillomaviruses (HPV), especially HPV16, which is associated with a better prognosis in oropharyngeal carcinoma and has therefore been included in the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours [56], does not play a significant role as a prognostic factor in laryngeal carcinoma [57]. Several retrospective studies with laryngeal carcinoma patients show that neither the detection of p16(INK4A) as an HPV surrogate marker nor HPV E6/E7 mRNA significantly correlates with survival [58, 59]. In recent decades, the expression of numerous proteins and RNAs as well as the presence/ absence of specific genomic and epigenetic alterations have been investigated in retrospective studies and correlated with the response to therapy or the prognosis of patients with laryngeal carcinoma. However, to date, no prognostic and/or predictive biomarker or biomarker pattern has been established as part of routine clinical diagnostics and thus used for therapy decisions. In this context, current studies focus in particular on the detection of genetic or epigenetic aberrations in order to identify patients at high risk for treatment failure or to establish innovative strategies in the sense of personalized therapy [60, 61]. However, initial promising data must first be validated in larger prospective studies. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.2. Definition of anatomical regions, TNM 29 4.2. Definition of anatomical regions, TNM The larynx is divided into three regions: • Supraglottis • glottis • Subglottis These three regions are also considered separately in the TNM classification [56]. The preepiglottic space is of particular importance for tumor extension. Figure 1: The three regions of the larynx [62] 4.2.1. TNM classification of laryngeal carcinoma and R classification (2017) 4.3. Consensus-based statement EEC The tumor stages according to the TNM classification are the most important prognostic factors in laryngeal carcinoma and should be applied in all cases in the currently valid version. The R classification should be indicated. Additional parameters to be assessed on the primary tumor include: lymphatic vessel, vein and perineural sheath invasion and degree of differentiation. To determine the T category, the clinician should communicate the assessment of vocal fold mobility to the pathologist. Strong consensus: 100% The anatomical spread of carcinomas of the larynx is described by the TNM classification [56]. This classification only applies to carcinomas, whereby malignant tumors of the larynx are squamous cell carcinomas in more than 90% of cases. Rare adenocarcinomas are also classified according to TNM. The classification does not apply to sarcomas, malignant lymphomas or metastases in the larynx. There are separate classifications for the anatomical regions supraglottis (ICD-1O C32.1) with the exception of the lingual surface of the epiglottus (ICD-10 C 10.1) and the lateral surface of the aryepiglottic fold (ICD-10 C13.1), glottis (ICD-1O C32.0) and subglottis (ICD-10 C32.2). In addition, some © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.2. Definition of anatomical regions, TNM 30 Sub-districts are delimited (e.g. in the glottis, vocal folds and anterior and posterior commissure), which are important in the definition of the T-categories. A distinction is made between a clinical cTNM classification and a pathological pTNM classification based on the resected specimen. For the basic handling of the TNM system, please refer to the current manual (see above); some special features of the corresponding categories are briefly mentioned here. Category T: The categories T4b/pT4b are identical in all three locations (T4b = tumor infiltrates the prevertebral space, mediastinal structures or encloses the internal carotid artery). As a rule, surgery is no longer advisable once a clinical T4b has been determined. The definition of the category T4a/pT4a is also identical for the three locations. In the collaboration between surgeons and pathologists, it is important to ensure that in resection specimens that contain external muscles of the tongue, these muscles are clearly identified by the surgeon for the pathologist, as otherwise there is a risk of miscategorization and no pT4a classification. The definitions of the T3/pT3 categories are defined differently for the locations and are adapted to the respective spread behavior of the carcinomas in the various areas. This statement also applies to the definitions of the T2/pT2 category. In the definitions of the T1/ pT1 categories, the carcinomas are limited to the respective areas (sub-region of the subglottis, vocal cord with/without anterior/posterior commissure, subglottis) with normal vocal cord mobility. For the pathological pT classification, in some cases, information on limited mobility or fixation of the vocal cords must be available, which must therefore be communicated to the pathologist on the submission form. The integral final pathological classification follows the principle of General Rule No. 2 of the TNM system: \"the pathological classification is based on findings obtained before treatment, supplemented or modified by additional findings obtained during surgery or by pathological examination.\" In invasive carcinomas, the classification is based only on the invasive component. To indicate the presence of an associated carcinoma in situ (immediately adjacent or separate) the flag \"(is)\" can be added to the appropriate T category, e.g. T2(is). The presence of an additional carcinoma in situ may influence treatment and should therefore be mentioned. Category N: In the 8th edition of the TNM classification, the definitions of the N classifications have changed, whereby the clinical (cN) differs from the pathological N classification (pN). If only a tissue sample was taken from the lymph node, the clinical classification (cN) is used. Category M: For the description of distant metastases, the categories cM0, cM1 and pM1 are distinguished. pM0 can only be used when presenting the results of autopsies of © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.2. Definition of anatomical regions, TNM 31 patients who died of laryngeal carcinoma. This must be distinguished from an aM0 (or apM0), which must be used if laryngeal carcinoma that was not known during the patient's lifetime is discovered during the autopsy. The categories MX and pMX no longer exist. In studies, combinations of the T, N and M categories should generally be evaluated, e.g. T1N0M0 or T3N1M0. Since this is often not possible due to small case numbers, it is also possible for laryngeal carcinomas to group different combinations into stages (identical for carcinomas of the supraglottis, glottis and subglottis): Table 7: Stages / T, N and M categories stage T N M Stage 0 Tis N0 M0 Stage I T1 N0 M0 Stage II T2 N0 M0 Stage III T1, T2 N1 M0 T3 N0, N1 M0 Stage IV T1, T2, T3, N2 M0 T4a N0, N1, N2 M0 Stage IV Every T N3 M0 T4b Every N M0 Stage IV Every T Every N M1 The categories of the R classification are clearly defined. R is not part of the obligatory TNM classification, but describes the presence of residual tumor after therapy, usually after surgical treatment. Since the application of the R classification provides important information on any necessary further therapy and the patient's prognosis, and since this is required in the S3 guidelines, some principles are presented below. Carcinomas that were resected without complications are defined as R0; the exact distance of tumor clusters from the resection margin is not important as long as the immediate margin is tumor-free. The minimum distance of the tumor clusters from the resection margin should be specified exactly for all relevant resection margins (in mm/cm, see below). An R1 situation exists when the tumor microscopically reaches one of the preparation edges, an R2 situation exists when macroscopically the tumor remains in the patient (this also applies, for example, in the case of a primary tumor that was operated on without surgery and clinically known metastases that were not treated surgically). An RX situation exists when the resection margin cannot be reliably assessed histomorphologically (eg in the case of heavily fragmented material). For a more comprehensive explanation of the categories, see the relevant literature [56]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.3.

Histopathological report 33 The following parameters, some of which are also associated with or depicted in pTNM, also influence the treatment decision: • Tumor location and size • histological tumor type according to current WHO classification [47, 48] • Local tumor extension, infiltrated structures • Lymph node metastases (number of lymph nodes examined, number of affected lymph nodes, largest diameter of lymph node metastases, tumor growth beyond the capsule) • Lymphatic/venous invasion and perineural invasion • Presence of an in situ component (with size) • Differentiation of the tumor according to the currently valid grading scheme [63] • Distance to the lateral and basal resection margins (cm/mm) for all relevant resection margins (distance from the tumor <5 mm) as well as for the invasive and in situ components separately. The corresponding parameters mentioned above must be specified exactly in the histopathological report (where applicable). For biopsies, the number of parameters is naturally reduced. Biopsies: Clinically, in biopsies of a manifest macroscopically clear neoplasm, the sample should be taken from the edge of the tumor and, if possible, centrally from the base of the tumor (see also below). The examination order to the pathologist must contain all clinically relevant information. If the findings are unclear, the biopsy should be repeated after consultation with the pathologist. Resectates: In the case of resected specimens, the surgeon should send the tumor specimen to the pathologist with a clear description of the anatomical topography (thread or color marking, needle marking, clock face diagram) [62]. In case of doubt, a personal consultation should be arranged. In the case of a neck dissection, the levels must be marked separately or - preferably - sent in portions as individual specimens for pathohistological examination. The cut edges on the resected specimen can be examined using frozen sections according to clinical relevance so that, if tumor involvement is present, further resection can be performed in the same session. En bloc sending and preparation of the edges by the pathologist using frozen sections is preferred. Areas with specific clinical questions should be marked separately. This procedure preserves the integrity of the specimen as best as possible and allows the most reliable statement on the R status, since small-scale samples do not have to be retrospectively adapted virtually to one another. If a safe en-bloc resection is not possible, it is appropriate to send separate marginal sections, which should ideally also be sent to the pathologists as frozen sections. After laser surgery, the assessment of the margins is often difficult due to carbonization or heat damage to the tissue. In this case, it is also usually not possible to send en-bloc resected specimens. The marginal sections that have to be taken separately should therefore be obtained with \"cold\" instruments. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","4.3. Histopathological report 34 Lymph nodes: Local metastasis of the primary tumor to the neck lymph nodes is a reliable negative predictor of the prognosis, with the disease course becoming more unfavorable the more lymph nodes are affected. Involvement of the caudal levels (IV and V) and growth beyond the capsule also have a negative impact on the prognosis [64-72]. The surgeon prefers to portion the levels, since even with markings, exact ex-situ classification in pathology is only possible to a very limited extent. Severing lymph nodes (especially those with metastases) should be avoided; the lymph nodes should be assigned to the level in which the largest lymph node diameter is visible. Structures of particular interest should be marked separately. The histopathological findings of the neck dissection specimens should include the side of the neck, the levels removed, the total number of lymph nodes with the number of affected lymph nodes per level, the diameter of the largest lymph node metastasis, additional removed structures and - if available - information about growth beyond the lymph node capsule. The detection of isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes or of micrometastases that can only be detected by immunohistology is currently of unclear clinical relevance [73].

In transoral laser surgical resection of T1/T2 glottic carcinomas, a safety margin of at least 1 mm may be sufficient [75, 76]. In laryngectomy for T3 and T4a carcinomas, a safety margin of 5 mm should be maintained [77-79].

Consensus-based recommendation EEC In the case of laryngeal cancer, it does not make sense to screen the entire population. Strong consensus: 100% 5.2. Consensus-based statement EEC Screening for laryngeal carcinoma in a high-risk population (smokers, regular large consumption of alcohol) cannot be recommended because evidence of effectiveness, i.e. a reduction in the incidence of invasive carcinomas and mortality, is currently lacking. Strong consensus: 100% The typical symptoms of laryngeal carcinoma, which are usually similar to banal inflammations, are often not associated with the presence of a malignant disease. In addition, due to the rarity of laryngeal carcinoma, doctors and patients have little knowledge of its etiology and early symptoms. This often leads to a delay in diagnosis. However, laryngeal carcinoma is in principle a disease suitable for early detection, as at least some of the carcinomas develop from precursor lesions that are clinically recognizable as leukoplakia/erythroplakia. Little is known about the time it takes for the carcinoma to progress. The pre- and early stages of laryngeal carcinoma can be treated surgically using minimally invasive techniques with very good success [80]. This can also improve the chances of recovery. However, there is no data on the benefit of early detection. Laryngoscopic examination can detect early carcinomas or Dysplasia/intraepithelial neoplasia can also be detected in patients without symptoms. The early detection program of the statutory Health insurance does not currently cover screening for laryngeal cancer. In the case of laryngeal cancer, it is not sensible to screen the entire population. Risk groups can be defined: men and women who regularly smoke heavily (more than 20 cigarettes/day for more than 20 years) and regularly consume large amounts of alcohol (12 grams of pure alcohol corresponding to 1/8 l of wine for women and 24 grams of pure alcohol corresponding to ¼ l of wine or ½ l of beer for men) have an increased risk of developing laryngeal cancer. The cancer risk is superadditive when both risk factors are present. Epidemiological studies have shown that in the risk group of smokers, the prevalence of clinically recognizable precursor lesions was around 3-5% and that of carcinomas was 0.1-0.2% [81]. Similar prevalences have been reported by others [82]. Löhler et al. [83] found squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx in 1.8% of 608 asymptomatic patients with corresponding risk constellation. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","5. Early detection 37 In contrast to the oral mucosa, which is accessible to direct inspection, laryngoscopy (rigid 90° or flexible endoscopy) must be performed for the early detection of laryngeal carcinoma. Mucosal changes suspected of being precursor lesions must be biopsied. Non-contact diagnostic methods such as electronic chromoendoscopy (narrow band imaging), autofluorescence endoscopy, high-speed glottography [84, 85] or hyperspectral imaging [86] are not yet used in clinical routine. However, initial studies indicate that these methods may be able to detect early carcinomas and precursor lesions in the larynx and differentiate them from benign proliferations, so that they could possibly also be used for screening in the future [87]. The risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment must be taken into account in every screening test. Therefore, the findings must be critically evaluated in order to avoid unnecessary treatment. In order to prevent the development of laryngeal cancer, it is desirable to implement primary prevention measures such as abstinence from tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption. Even in long-term smokers, giving up smoking can reduce the risk of cancer. The focus should be on improving public education to prevent the still frequent delay in diagnosis [88]. The typical symptoms of laryngeal cancer such as hoarseness and dysphagia must be made known, especially to those at risk. If hoarseness persists for more than 4 weeks, laryngoscopy is essential, especially in those at risk. Screening for laryngeal cancer cannot currently be recommended even in high-risk groups because there is currently no evidence of effectiveness, i.e. a reduction in incidence and mortality. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.1. Clinical examination 38 6. Clinical diagnostics 6.1. Clinical examination 6.1. Consensus-based recommendation EEC All patients with hoarseness lasting more than 4 weeks should undergo endoscopic examination of the larynx. Consensus: 95% 6.2. Consensus-based recommendation EEC The symptoms of laryngeal carcinoma depend on the location of the tumor and are not always accompanied by a change in the voice, so that an endoscopic laryngeal examination should be performed even if swallowing disorders persist for several weeks or even increase. Strong consensus: 100% Any change in the voice or swallowing with a foreign body sensation is a suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma. All areas of the larynx can be affected and lead to different symptoms. Since the laryngeal mucosa is not accessible to direct inspection, visible tissue changes that are more prominent in other locations cannot be directly detected by the patient or the doctor. Appropriate endoscopic/mirror examinations must be carried out. The symptoms vary greatly depending on the location of the carcinoma. In supraglottic carcinomas, difficulty swallowing, a lump in the throat and pain when swallowing (radiating into the ear) predominate. In glottic carcinomas, hoarseness is the main symptom. Subglottic carcinomas usually only manifest themselves late in the form of breathing difficulties. If the above symptoms persist for more than four weeks, specialist medical assessment is required. Lymph node swelling in the neck may already be present initially, which can be confused with inflammatory diseases such as pharyngo-laryngitis or lymphadenitis. Progressive tumor growth leads to increasing functional impairments such as significant voice and breathing disorders, difficulty swallowing and nutritional disorders with weight loss. Severe pain develops, radiating to the entire head and neck region. In up to 40% of patients with supraglottic carcinomas, the neck lymph nodes may be affected at the time of initial diagnosis despite a clinically unremarkable neck [89, 90]. Immediate referral to a specialist should be made if the following findings persist for more than four weeks: • hoarseness • Difficulty speaking and breathing • Persistent, especially one-sided foreign body sensation • Pain radiating to the ear © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.2. Difference between pT classification and cT classification 39 • Difficulty swallowing and/or pain when swallowing • unclear hemoptysis • Swelling on the neck • Foetor ex ore More intensive education of the population and accelerated referral of patients with unclear findings and with special risk constellations to specialists are necessary in order to shorten the time interval from the first symptom to the onset of tumor-specific treatment The clinical examination when laryngeal carcinoma is suspected includes endoscopy of the larynx in the phonation and respiratory positions. A 90° magnifying laryngoscope should be used for this, although surface anesthesia of the throat usually improves the examination options. Many patients with malignancies of the head and neck region have a significant gag reflex, which makes indirect examination of the larynx via the oral cavity difficult or even impossible. In such cases, only a flexible endoscopic examination is possible with a 4 mm flexible rhino-pharyngo-laryngoscope, which is advanced via the lower nasal passage and the throat to the larynx after local surface anesthesia. In addition to assessing pathological mucosal changes, special attention must be paid to vocal cord mobility. A phoniatric examination to assess the vibration behavior of the vocal cords, particularly in the case of very small, pathological mucosal changes that are suspected of being malignant, with the aid of a stroboscope is recommended. Systemic tumor spread, particularly in the lungs, is also possible. If several regions of the larynx or pharynx are affected at the same time, this is referred to as multilocular tumor growth. For this reason and because of the possible presence of synchronous secondary carcinomas in the pharynx or larynx, endoscopy of the adjacent mucous membrane areas, e.g. with a 90° magnifying laryngoscope or with a flexible rhino-pharyngo-laryngoscope, is part of the clinical primary diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma. During panendoscopy under anesthesia, the tracheobronchial system and the esophagus can also be examined to exclude further secondary carcinomas. Suspicious lesions away from the primary tumor should be biopsied separately. In these situations, a mapping biopsy in unremarkable mucosal areas may also be useful. The clinical examination also includes palpation of the neck to detect lymph node metastases, which is supplemented by ultrasound and CT/MRI if neoplasia is suspected. Newer endoscopic procedures such as coherence tomography, autofluorescence and electronic chromoendoscopy (narrow band imaging) can also be used. 6.2. Difference between pT classification and cT classification The majority of published systematic studies that relate clinical diagnostics to pathological results focus on the question of whether existing lesions are correctly identified as such by clinical diagnostics and whether the dignity of these lesions is correctly assigned by clinical diagnostics. There are hardly any systematic studies on the question of the differences between clinical and pathological T-classification. Individual © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.2. Difference between pT classification and cT classification 40 When comparing different imaging techniques, publications show a comparable accuracy in relation to the T-classification obtained by pathological examination. When all T categories are included, sonography, CT and MRI allow a T classification that corresponds to the pT category in 75-80% of all patients [91-94]. While CT diagnostics tend to underestimate the T category, MRI tends to overestimate the T category [91, 95]. The highest rates of up to 88% are achieved with MRI. Agreement rates have been reported [95]. Agreement increases significantly for CT and MRI from low T categories to high T categories, with a range between 50% and 88%. For endoscopic procedures, the agreement across all T categories is 40-55% [92, 95]. Endoscopic procedures usually underestimate the T category, with the exception of pT1. Electronic chromoendoscopy enables an improvement in the detection of tumor margins and thus also an improvement in the determination of the T category [96]. A therapy-relevant diagnostic decision regarding the T classification in laryngeal carcinoma is the question of tumor infiltration of the laryngeal cartilage. An overestimation of the T category due to a false-positive assessment of cartilage infiltration can lead to overtreatment in the form of surgical removal of the larynx with a correspondingly significant reduction in quality of life [97]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.3. Imaging 41 6.3. Imaging 6.3. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Imaging should be performed in the following patients with laryngeal cancer: • Carcinomas of the vocal cords with restricted movement or fixation • Carcinomas of the anterior commissure with supra- and/or subglottic extension • Carcinomas of the supraglottis except when located at the free edge of the epiglottis • Carcinomas with subglottic extension. Consensus: 95% 6.4. Consensus-based recommendation EEC If imaging is indicated to determine the local extent of laryngeal carcinoma, contrast- enhanced CT and/or MRI should be performed. Strong consensus: 100% 6.5. Consensus-based recommendation EEC To determine the N category in patients in whom an MRI or CT is required to diagnose the spread of the primary tumor, the entire region from the skull base to the upper thoracic aperture should be examined simultaneously with CT or MRI. Consensus: 95% Small carcinomas, particularly of the glottis, cannot always be visualized by imaging and are diagnosed endoscopically. In the case of larger carcinomas, the entire extent cannot be assessed using endoscopy. For this purpose, imaging in the form of CT and/or MRI is essential. Ultrasound plays only a minor role in the diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma, but it can help to detect possible neck lymph node metastases. In laryngeal carcinoma, imaging plays a very important role in deciding on treatment in conjunction with clinical examination methods [91, 99, 100]. The need for imaging depends on the location of the tumor. Small glottic carcinomas cannot be visualized or can only be visualized poorly by imaging. In these cases, endoscopy plays a central role in determining the extent of the tumor. Important additional information from the ENT doctor to © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.3. Imaging 42 The radiologist is concerned with vocal cord mobility. If the vocal cord is fixed, a deeper infiltration is assumed. MRI is the imaging method of choice due to its best soft tissue resolution. Computed tomography is preferable to MRI if, in individual cases, it is expected that disease-related movement artifacts in the larynx area will complicate diagnosis. The short acquisition time of CT is a clear advantage here. It also enables examination in E-phonation, in which, in contrast to spontaneous breathing, the vocal folds are in a symmetrical middle position. Deviations from symmetry can thus be sensitive signs that facilitate the detection of discrete pathological findings [101]. The use of iodine-containing contrast agents improves soft tissue contrast in CT and thus significantly increases the diagnostic value of CT. MRI can provide additional information on the question of infiltration of the cartilage skeleton. In advanced metastatic (≥ 2)In the case of laryngeal carcinoma, a CT of the thorax and abdomen or a CT of the thorax and an ultrasound of the abdomen should be performed to exclude distant metastases. As an alternative to CT thorax/abdomen, a whole-body FDG-PET-CT can be performed to exclude or objectify distant metastases (see chapter6.3.1 ). Supraglottic carcinomas When planning the operation, the endoscopic findings are primarily decisive in determining whether, for example, a horizontal partial laryngeal resection is possible. However, the endoscopic findings must be supplemented by CT or MRI [102], which can show the extent of the tumor beyond the supraglottic space or the epiglottis into the preepiglottic space [103], into the vallecula or into the base of the tongue [104]. In such cases, the tumor can be removed while preserving the glottis, but to the detriment of the structures protecting the laryngeal entrance. The imaging also provides important information about whether the procedure can be performed transorally, e.g. using laser surgery, or whether the tumor must be removed transcervically due to its extent. Glottic carcinomas CT or MRI are the imaging procedures of choice for local spread diagnostics. CT is the method of choice for further clarification of spread in the thorax area. For the assessment of thyroid cartilage infiltration, MRI is slightly superior to CT in terms of detection. The assessment of the infiltration of the laryngeal carcinoma into the cartilage skeleton of the larynx is particularly important in pre-therapeutic diagnostics, as this has significant consequences for T-staging and therapeutic procedures. While the arytenoid cartilage is usually easily accessible for clinical-endoscopic examination, this is not the case with the thyroid cartilage, the largest cartilage in the larynx. An assessment of tumor infiltration of the thyroid cartilage is therefore only possible using cross-sectional imaging techniques. The sensitivity of CT in this question is 62-87% compared to histopathological examination as the gold standard and with a specificity of 75- © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.3. Imaging 43 98%, a PPV of 63-82% and an NPV of 85-92% [97, 104-107]. For MRI, the sensitivity is 64-95%, the specificity is 56-88%, the PPV is 45-73% and the NPV is 84-96% [93, 105, 108]. One possible reason for this wide range of test quality criteria is the difficulty of both methods, mentioned by all authors, in distinguishing tumorous infiltration from peritumorous inflammation [94]. Recent studies show that by using T2 weighting or diffusion-weighted MRI imaging, the accuracy can be improved to 85-88%, the sensitivity to 85-93%, the specificity to 82-85%, the PPV to 85-88% and the NPV to 85-90% [109, 110]. Infiltration of the inner cartilage lamella tends to be diagnosed with greater accuracy than infiltration of the outer lamella [110]. For sonography, the sensitivity in assessing cartilage infiltration is 67%, the specificity is 92%, the PPV is 75%, the NPV is 84% and the accuracy is 85% [93]. Sonography is therefore inferior to CT and MRI. Infiltration of the paraglottic space can also be better assessed with MRI than with sonography. The accuracy of detecting tumor infiltration for MRI/sonography is 90%/83% supraglottic, 83%/ 80% subglottic and 87%/83% paraglottic [93]. Infiltration of the preepiglottic space is rather overestimated with MRI [91]. The assessment of infiltration of the anterior commissure can be achieved with MRI with an accuracy of 87-100% [91, 93]. Background to Recommendation 6.5. If patients come for evaluation at an early stage of vocal cord carcinoma, the diagnosis is initially made by endoscopic examination. In the case of small lesions, imaging is usually not able to show the pathological changes in the vocal cord with sufficient accuracy [111]. In the case of larger lesions, imaging using contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI can show the extent of the tumor in depth or possible submucosal spread much more accurately than clinical examination. Carcinomas that reach the anterior commissure can lead to infiltration of the thyroid cartilage or even grow beyond the thyroid cartilage into the prelaryngeal tissue. The detection of such tumor infiltration by CT and/or MRI is of great importance for further surgical treatment planning, since in these situations the indication for transoral endoscopic laser surgical tumor excision is often no longer given. In such cases, high-resolution MRI is superior to CT. However, CT offers the possibility of performing functional examinations such as e- phonation and Valsalva maneuver [101]. However, MRI may have a higher sensitivity, especially in early glottic carcinomas [112]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.3. Imaging 44 6.3.1. PET-CT in laryngeal carcinoma 6.6. Evidence-based recommendation Recommendation level After combined radio-chemotherapy, surveillance using FDG-PET-CT should be performed in node-positive patients with laryngeal carcinoma (>/=N2) as an alternative to planned salvage neck dissection. B Level of Evidence [113-117] 1b Consensus: 82% Imaging based purely on morphological information has certain limitations, for example in the detection of small carcinomas in clinically unremarkable organs. In this context, 18FDG PET/CT has a significantly higher accuracy (sensitivity > 95%) compared to staging with CT, MRI and sonography [113, 118]. This can have a significant influence on the choice of treatment regimen and thus also on the patient's prognosis [119]. For example, Connel et al. [120] were able to show that after performing 18FDG PET/CT as part of primary staging, up to 29% of patients have a correction of the clinical TNM classification and thus a change in the treatment regimen [120]. 18FDG PET/CT even shows a higher detection rate of small carcinomas than panendoscopy (6.1% vs. 4.5%). PET/CT, on the other hand, only shows a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 87% in the detection of clinically non-manifest lymph node metastases [121]. It is useful in preoperative staging for the detection of clinically non-manifest lymph node metastases in addition to the usual clinical examinations. Ozer et al. [117] found that PET/CT offers no advantage in the diagnosis of clinical N0 neck. Minovi et al. [116] came to the same conclusion, finding that PET is currently not unreservedly recommended for the pre-therapeutic evaluation of lymph node metastases, although it appears to be superior to MRI in terms of the detection rate. Richard et al. [115] also came to the conclusion that PET/CT has no reliable predictive value for the need for neck dissection in clinical NO neck. They found false positive lymph node staging in 27% of the levels and false negative lymph node staging in 12%. In March 2017, the Federal Joint Committee decided in accordance with Section 91 of the Social Code Book V that PET/CT is part of the standard service for head and neck tumors and can therefore be used as an important diagnostic measure in specifically indicated cases. If a metastasis is detected in a single lymph node of category N2b or N2c or an involved lymph node measures more than 3 cm in maximum diameter (N2a or N3), there is a higher risk of distant metastases. In this case, a whole-body FDG-PET-CT can be performed as an alternative to CT of the thorax/abdomen to exclude or objectify distant metastases. (Sensitivity for the detection of distant metastases 96.8%, specificity 95.4%, positive predictive value 69.8%, and negative predictive value 99.6% [113]. However, some studies see no significant advantage of PET/CT over CT [122-124] © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.4. Panendoscopy to exclude secondary carcinomas 45 FDG-PET-CT plays a role in the follow-up of node-positive patients who have undergone primary combined radio-chemotherapy. In general, however, the value of PET-CT is controversial. Mehanna et al. [114] found that survival rates were comparable between patients who underwent PET-CT surveillance and those who underwent elective neck dissection. PET-CT surveillance resulted in a considerably lower rate of surgery (54 vs. 221). Quality of life was considered to be the same in both groups. 6.4. Panendoscopy to exclude Secondary carcinomas 6.7. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Panendoscopy should be performed in patients with laryngeal carcinoma. Consensus: 95% Panendoscopy includes esophagoscopy, tracheobronchoscopy, pharyngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy and inspection of the oral cavity. The information on the frequency of clinically occult secondary carcinomas varies considerably in the literature, from 1% to over 10%. There are indications that the frequency of secondary carcinomas depends on the stage of the primary tumor. In patients suffering from laryngeal carcinoma, particularly those who smoke and regularly drink large amounts of alcohol, there is a probability that these noxious substances have also caused carcinomas or their precursor lesions in other regions of the upper respiratory and digestive tract. The extent of this probability varies greatly in the literature [125-131]. Secondary carcinomas can occur synchronously or metachronously. Synchronous secondary carcinomas can be clinically noticeable during the ENT examination at the time of the manifestation of the laryngeal carcinoma, or they can be identified by the specific symptoms. Panendoscopy is suitable for excluding or detecting clinically occult secondary carcinomas and their precursors. It is therefore one of the diagnostic measures that is usually carried out before a therapeutic decision is made for a histologically proven laryngeal carcinoma. The information on the frequency of clinically occult secondary carcinomas varies considerably in the literature, from 1% to over 10%. There are indications that the frequency of secondary carcinomas depends on the stage of the primary tumor. In principle, the majority of experts agree, based on the publications, that panendoscopy should generally be performed as part of the staging process, except for stage I glotis carcinomas, but especially in patients with special risk factors such as tobacco smoke and/or excessive alcohol consumption, as well as in patients with a higher tumor stage. If panendoscopy is recommended, it should include the entire upper respiratory and digestive tract, except for the nose and nasopharynx, i.e. the entire oral cavity, the entire oropharynx and hypopharynx are examined. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.5. Excisional biopsies, biopsies 46 and the larynx are inspected. In addition, an endoscopy of the tracheobronchial system and the esophagus is performed. The inspection of the oral cavity and the oropharynx can be done directly without an endoscope, but the assessment of the mucous membrane, the base of the tongue, the hypopharynx and the larynx should be done with an endoscope. Laryngoscopes such as the so-called Kleinsasser tube are usually used for this purpose. Endoscopy of the tracheobronchial system can be performed using rigid endoscopes with different angles. Esophagoscopy can also be performed using a rigid, preferably pneumatic esophagoscope. Due to possible complications such as perforation of the esophageal wall, particularly at the transition from the pyriform sinus into the esophagus, but also distally from it, some authors recommend that esophagoscopy be performed exclusively using a flexible endoscope. Tracheobronchoscopy can also be performed flexibly using optical technology. Panendoscopy is usually performed together with endoscopy of the known tumor region (larynx), which also includes a tissue sample. In the presence of laryngeal carcinoma, microlaryngoscopy, which is also performed as part of the panendoscopy, is particularly important in order to be able to define the extent of the primary tumor, especially superficial mucosal changes that cannot be detected by imaging. In addition, microlaryngoscopy performed before therapy can determine whether the entire larynx can be adjusted endoscopically in order to possibly perform a transoral laser surgical resection during definitive therapy or whether a transcervical larynx operation as partial or total removal is necessary. In these situations, a mapping biopsy can also be useful. 6.5. Excisional biopsies, biopsies 6.8. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Small, circumscribed mucosal changes that are suspected of being malignant, e.g. of the vocal cords, should be completely removed to confirm the diagnosis (excisional biopsy). In the case of larger tumors, only biopsies should be performed. Consensus: 95% The removal of a tissue sample and its histopathological examination with detection/exclusion of a malignant tumor or a precursor lesion is an indispensable prerequisite for the initiation of tumor-specific therapy [62]. It is generally recommended to perform imaging relevant for further treatment before taking a tissue sample, as the biopsy can lead to tissue reactions that make an imaging assessment difficult or distorted. In the case of macroscopically clearly identifiable advanced tumors, the tissue sample should preferably be taken from the edge of the tumor, i.e. the progression zone, and not only from the necrotic center. However, the collection of tumor parts from non-necrotic areas is also desirable where possible.

Sentinel lymph nodes 47 Biopsies are obtained in macroscopically clear, advanced tumors by incision biopsy with micro scissors or sharp forceps (Blakesly). An excision biopsy should be performed in the case of circumscribed lesions without deep infiltration. This procedure is particularly suitable for older patients in order to avoid a second procedure under anesthesia if possible in the case of in sano resection (R0). Mucosal areas that are suspected of having a precursor lesion should also be examined by excision biopsy (see also above). A so-called brush biopsy is not recommended. Photo documentation of the tumor during endoscopy under anesthesia and before taking the sample is desirable and is of great use in later treatment decisions. If the histology result is unexpectedly negative, the biopsy should be repeated at least once. The histomorphological parameters to be specified are set out above; the description of the R status is only useful for excision biopsy. 6.6. Sentinel lymph nodes 6.9. Consensus-based statement EEC No recommendation can be made regarding the suitability of SLN biopsy as a method to avoid elective neck lymph node dissection in laryngeal carcinoma. Consensus: 95% Sentinel lymph nodes are the lymph nodes that are located closest to the tumor in the lymph drainage area of a malignant tumor. If tumor cells have already been carried along with the lymph flow in these lymph nodes and have led to a metastasis, then further metastases are likely to be found in downstream lymph nodes. If, on the other hand, no metastases are found in the removed sentinel lymph node, there is a low probability that further lymph node metastases are present. The sentinel lymph node technique is a clinically established technique for breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma. The removal of a sentinel lymph node after radionuclide injection and intraoperative detection with a measuring probe to indicate a neck dissection in laryngeal carcinoma is controversial. There is some evidence in the literature [132-134] that sentinel node dissection has a therapeutic benefit in supraglottic carcinoma and can play a special role in the staging of the cN0 neck. The same applies to the indication of a neck dissection in the event that the histopathological processing of the sentinel node in the frozen section reveals a metastasis. Other authors [135, 136] view this more critically and indicate a neck dissection based on other factors such as the tumor location (supraglottis) and the tumor category (≥T2). In Germany, sentinel node dissection is extremely rarely used in laryngeal carcinoma, although the indicated neck dissection in the cN0 neck is performed for both diagnostic and prophylactic reasons. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.7 Patient information / education 48 6.7.

Consensus: 83% Informing the patient about what is to be done to him, what means are to be used, and what risks and consequences are involved is a prerequisite for the patient's informed consent to therapy [137]. It is legally mandatory (BGB, MBO, ...) and is the sole responsibility of the doctor. The information must be provided in good time so that the patient can make a well- considered decision about consent (§630e Para.2 No.2 BGB). A patient who is diagnosed with laryngeal carcinoma must come to terms with this situation. The briefing session with the treating doctor is very important for this. The patient needs enough time to come to terms with the diagnosis of carcinoma. This is why the briefing session is not usually given in a single session, but as a process that accompanies the course of the disease. In addition to the patient, relatives also play a major role. They should of course only be fully informed about the illness with the patient's consent, as they will support the patient in his or her home environment. After the diagnosis has been communicated, the patient is often not fully receptive. Much of what is explained to them in the first phase is often not properly understood, especially the consequences of treatment, be it an operation or radiotherapy. For this reason, it is important to inform relatives about the consequences of treatment. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.7 Patient information / education 49 Joint information between patient and family facilitates communication within the partnership and family. This should be communicated to the patient. Since laryngeal carcinoma can affect several functions, such as voice production, swallowing and breathing, the patient must be given a detailed explanation of the possible disorders that can arise after such an operation. This first information session with the patient and their relatives is important so that they can decide on the right therapy for them. However, the patient will often follow the recommendations of the treating doctor, which makes it all the more important to show the consequences of appropriate treatment. Since most patients have no idea about the anatomy of the larynx, the explanations must be clearly explained to the patient with the help of schematic drawings. Many patients also need to be aware of the seriousness of the disease; this is particularly true of smaller carcinomas that only lead to minor functional impairments such as mild hoarseness. In order to provide the patient with a broad picture of the treatment options, it is necessary to consult not only an ENT surgeon but also a radiotherapist (and, if appropriate, an internal oncologist) who can advise and weigh up radiotherapy (or internal therapy) versus surgical therapy. The patient must always be informed about the chances of success. If information is given on the probability of recovery, these should be given as absolute (and not relative) frequencies [138, 139]. Patients should also be informed about the likely risks and consequences of not undergoing treatment. The patient may also be present at the tumor board meetings so that the advantages and disadvantages of various treatment options, including the prospects of success, can be discussed in his or her presence. A representative of the Association of Larynxless People should also be included in the patient information session. It is very helpful if the patient can be put in touch with a patient who has undergone a similar therapy. This will help the patient understand the situation after therapy and give them a better idea of the functional impairments and the rehabilitation options. If the patient has decided to undergo treatment, they must of course be informed about this in detail. The information should be provided by the surgeon himself or by a doctor who has sufficient experience in the field of the proposed therapy. It is particularly important for the patient to be informed about the prognosis regarding voice production, breathing and swallowing as well as visible - and thus potentially stigmatizing - changes to the face and neck after the therapeutic measure [140]. It is also important whether a permanent tracheostomy or a temporary tracheotomy is performed, as well as whether a tracheostomy tube must be worn and, if so, what type (blocked or unblocked) it must be. In the case of partial laryngectomy, in addition to the possible impairment of voice production, aspiration is also a significant problem that the patient must be informed about. \"The person who has to consent to the medical procedure - usually the patient himself - must be informed.\" To inform the patient, © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.7 Patient information / education 50 appropriately illustrated, standardized information sheets are used to support the oral information, which is obligatory in all cases. In order to document the oral information given to the patient, it is essential that it be entered in the medical records. According to the Patient Rights Act, the patient must be given a copy of the information sheet [141]. The content of the information depends on the type of treatment; the radio-oncologist is responsible for providing information about primary radiotherapy. The ear, nose and throat specialist is responsible for providing information about surgical treatment. When treating primary tumors, a differentiation must be made, which includes both transoral laser surgery and transcervical surgery. The exact location of the tumor must also be taken into account, whereby the three levels, the subglottis, the glottis and the supraglottis, must be treated separately. In addition to treating the primary tumor, the patient must also be informed about the treatment of the lymphatic drainage routes. The need for an elective neck dissection as well as a therapeutic neck dissection must be fully explained to the patient. The patient must be informed that after the primary tumor has been treated, changes to the treatment recommendations are possible, taking into account the histological findings available at that time. These must then be explained again. Furthermore, in the case of a partial resection of the larynx, the temporary tracheotomy, which is sometimes necessary, must be discussed in detail with the patient. Since in many cases adjuvant therapy in the form of radiochemotherapy is necessary in addition to surgical treatment for extensive tumors, particularly in cases of proven lymph node metastasis, the patient must also be informed of this. In particular, it must be explained to the patient why adjuvant therapy in the form of radiation and chemotherapy is necessary despite the surgical removal of the tumor. Chemotherapy accompanying radiotherapy has become established in recent years, and patients must be informed in detail by the internal oncologist about the benefits of this additional treatment, with an explanation of the corresponding side effects. The doctor providing the information should also consider how the patient is able to psychologically process the information provided. He should counteract irrational “subjective theories of illness” [142]. Despite truthful information, hope can be conveyed even in the case of an unfavourable prognosis, if necessary through information about palliative Treatment options. Psycho-oncologically experienced staff can be helpful for psychologically stressed patients and/or their relatives (see chapter7.10.3.2 ). In clinical trials, the patient must be informed in detail about the content of the study in advance and must of course be free to decide whether he or she is available for a corresponding study. If tissue is to be preserved in tumor biobanks, the patient must also be given detailed information. The treating physician must explain to the patient the advantages of such a biobank for future research projects. It must also be explained to the patient that this will enable further future research projects [143]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","6.7 Patient information / education 51 Since the majority of laryngeal carcinomas are caused by noxious substances such as smoking and alcohol abuse, this connection must be clearly explained to the patient, especially with regard to his behavior after therapy. The patient's information also includes the possibilities of functional rehabilitation, e.g. through speech therapy measures and the PEG system, which may be considered appropriate. When the patient is discharged from hospital, the doctors who will continue to treat him or her should be informed of the reasons for the choice of treatment. This includes not only information about the type and extent of the tumor being treated, but also information about the decision-making process by the tumor board and the patient. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.1. Pretherapeutic tracheotomy 52 7. Treatment recommendations 7.1. Consensus-based recommendation EEC The treatment of laryngeal carcinoma should be carried out in an interdisciplinary manner after coordination of each individual case within tumor boards with the involvement of the specialist disciplines of otolaryngology, radiotherapy, medical oncology, pathology and radiology. Strong consensus: 96% 7.1. Pretherapeutic tracheotomy 7.2. Consensus-based statement EEC A tracheostomy performed before a laryngectomy has a negative impact on the prognosis because stoma recurrences occur more frequently. Strong consensus: 100% 7.3. Consensus-based recommendation EEC A tracheotomy should be avoided before a planned total laryngectomy. In the case of dyspnea, transoral tumor debulking can be performed as part of the initial diagnosis to avoid a tracheotomy. Strong consensus: 100% When laryngeal carcinoma is first diagnosed, significant dyspnea may already be present, which often requires pre-therapeutic tracheostomy. Patients with extensive laryngeal carcinoma are often admitted to hospital for emergency treatment. Primary tracheostomy is often performed as an emergency measure. Retrospective studies have shown that tracheostomy, which is necessary before laryngectomy or partial laryngectomy, has a negative impact on the prognosis [144-147]. In particular, recurrences in the tracheostomy area are frequently described in such cases, which are difficult to treat with both surgery and radiation. If a recurrence occurs in the area of the tracheostomy, the prognosis in terms of survival deteriorates considerably [148, 149]. If laryngectomy is considered as the primary treatment option, the procedure should be performed promptly in the case of dyspnea in order to avoid a pre-therapeutic tracheotomy, or the patient should remain intubated until the laryngectomy (exceptional cases). In addition, attempts can be made to avoid the tracheotomy, e.g. by endoscopic tumor debulking during the first examination under anesthesia. If the decision is made for primary radiotherapy, pre- therapeutic tracheotomy is unavoidable, although in order to prevent recurrence in the tracheostomy area, this should be included in the radiation field [150]. Another argument against an early tracheotomy before a planned laryngectomy is the special surgical technique advocated by Franz Hilgers et al. [151, 152], which ensures that the trachea is as intact as possible after © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.1. Pretherapeutic tracheotomy 53 This requires a deposition in the subcricoid soft tissue ring above the first tracheal clasp in order to create a shrinkage-free (cannula-free) tracheostomy with favorable conditions for the primary use of a voice prosthesis after the plastic tracheostomy has been created, including the edge of the first tracheal ring. The Hilgers surgical technique discussed here has proven to be particularly beneficial for voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy with voice prostheses. In the case of a planned partial laryngeal resection, the need for a temporary or even permanent tracheostomy depends on the location and extent of the tumor [153]. In the case of extensive frontolateral partial laryngeal resections, a temporary tracheostomy is often indicated, although this is recommended less to protect against aspiration than to prevent skin emphysema and swelling-related postoperative dyspnea. In the case of limited frontolateral partial laryngeal resections or in the case of a transcervical cordectomy (eg pure laryngofissure with poor patient adjustment), a tracheostomy can be dispensed with. In the case of a horizontal partial resection, a temporary tracheostomy is always necessary, as this can usually lead to significant swelling of the mucous membrane and the resulting narrowing of the glottis, as well as inevitable initial aspiration, so that in the first few days after surgery a blocked tracheostomy tube protects the lower airways and, during the subsequent swallowing training phase, an unblocked speaking tube supports the rehabilitation process until the desired closure of the tracheostomy. The risk of aspiration is significantly increased in patients older than 65 years [154-157], although with good patient selection (good lung function, sufficient cognition and motivation for speech therapy), an advanced patient age is not a contraindication for open partial resection [158-161]. A tracheostomy that is created after a partial laryngeal resection can in most cases be closed again depending on the extent of the resection, especially if it is a frontolateral partial resection. If radiotherapy was also performed, the time of tracheostomy closure can be delayed by several weeks and months. In the case of horizontal partial resections, tracheostomy closure is possible in principle, but can usually only be carried out at a later point in time (when there is no aspiration) compared to frontolateral partial resection. Even after transoral laser surgery (TLM), a temporary tracheotomy may be necessary to protect against aspiration (saliva, blood) if the resection is extensive, particularly in the supraglottic area. The literature describes the possibility of decannulation in 90% of cases of partial laryngeal resection, which could be performed within a period of 8 to over 30 days after completion of therapy. Overall, tracheostomy closure can be performed in up to 99% of patients after supraglottic partial resection [162]. In a systematic review of swallowing disorders after supracricoid partial resection, Lips et al. [163] concluded that postoperative dysphagia improves significantly within 3 months after surgery and that there is only a low rate of severe complications after long There is a follow-up period. Overall, tracheostomy closure can be performed in 90-99% of patients after partial supracricoid resection [162]. For this purpose, a taping attempt under inpatient conditions for at least 24 hours before surgical closure is recommended. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.2.

Consensus: 90% There are numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing transoral laser therapy and primary radiotherapy for T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinoma. However, according to a Cochrane review, only one randomized controlled trial from 1990 was found that collected meaningful data by comparing the oncological outcomes in 234 patients with T1 and T2 laryngeal carcinoma [165, 166]. One of the reasons for this is that planned randomized controlled trials on this issue were canceled or could not be started at all because feasibility analyses did not produce sufficient numbers of patients [164, 174]. Hamilton et al. [175] analyzed the factors responsible for the poor recruitment of the EaStER (Early Stage glottic cancer: Endoscopic excision or Radiotherapy) study [164]. They were able to show that not all recruiting physicians accepted the primary outcome parameter of the study and that the inclusion criteria were not followed in some cases. In addition, the recruiting physicians preferred the study arm with surgical therapy, which was also reflected in the way the study information was passed on to the patients and made randomization more difficult [175]. In the introduction, it is stated that T1/T2 laryngeal carcinomas predominantly affect tumor stages I and II and only need to be treated with adjuvant therapy if the criteria presented elsewhere are met (see also chapter7.3 ). Elective neck dissection is not indicated in stage I glottic carcinoma. Therapy results The 5-year overall survival after T1 vocal cord carcinoma is reported in the literature as being 74-100% [6]. An analysis of 2436 T1/T2 vocal cord carcinomas treated transorally showed a 5- year overall survival of 82% [172]. With regard to overall survival, cohort studies on T1 laryngeal carcinoma showed no difference between surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches [173]. A systematic review of case series and non-controlled studies from 2012 could not demonstrate any differences in overall survival between endolaryngeal surgery and radiotherapy when analyzing a total of 17 studies [167]. There are meta-analyses of observational studies comparing overall survival in patients with T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas after transoral laser surgery and radiotherapy [168]. One meta-analysis of observational studies showed a significantly better overall survival after laser therapy for T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas [168], the other two meta-analyses [169, 176], in which only T1 or T1a vocal cord carcinomas were evaluated, also showed a better survival after laser therapy, the © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.2. Carcinomas in UICC stages I and II: cT1 cN0 and cT2 cN0 56 However, the difference in survival rates was not statistically significant in a meta- analysis [169]. Canis et al. analyzed 277 patients after transoral surgery for supraglottic carcinomas, 22% of whom received adjuvant radiotherapy. After 5 years, control rates of 85% were achieved for T1 and T2 carcinomas. The 5-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 92% and 76% in stages I and II and 81% and 59% in stages III and IV [177]. Ambrosch et al. analyzed 48 patients with T1 and T2 supraglottic carcinomas. Here, the five-year rate for local control was 92% [178]. An analysis of 303 T1/T2 supraglottic carcinomas treated transorally endoscopically showed a 5-year overall survival of 70%, a disease-specific survival of 82% and a local control of 90% [172]. In an analysis of transoral laser surgery for T1-T4 supraglottic carcinomas, local control after 2 years was 97%, the disease-specific 2-year survival rate was 80%, and overall survival was 85%. Larynx preservation was achieved in 79% [179]. Iro et al. [180] analyzed 141 patients with T1-T4 supraglottic laryngeal carcinomas who were treated by transoral laser surgery and, if necessary, neck dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Local recurrences occurred in 16% of patients. Recurrence-free survival after 5 years was 65.7%, although this was stage-dependent (stage I: 85.0%; stage II: 62.6%; stage III: 74.2%, and stage IV 45.3%). For disease-specific survival after transoral resection of T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas, 5- year survival rates of 89-100% are reported in the literature [6]. In a 2011 meta-analysis on radiotherapy versus laser therapy for T1a glottic carcinoma, 8 observational studies (7 retrospective, 1 prospective) with a total of 1991 patients were evaluated with regard to disease-specific survival. There was no statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival; the pooled odds ratio was 1.60 (95% confidence interval 0.79-3.26) in favor of laser surgery [169]. Laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival Meta-analyses of laryngeal preservation after laser surgery for T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas report rates of 83%-100% [181]. A systematic review of mainly comparative retrospective observational studies and cross-sectional studies by Yoo et al. [167] showed a trend towards better laryngeal preservation with initial transoral surgery compared with radiotherapy. In the meta-analysis by Abdurehim et al., data from eight head-to-head observational studies with 1175 patients were evaluated for the endpoint: laryngeal preservation [169]. After transoral laser surgery compared with radiotherapy, the larynx was preserved statistically significantly more often (pooled OR=3.11; CI95% [1.1-8.34]). In a meta-analysis of 606 patients with T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas from four head-to-head observational studies, no significant difference in laryngectomy-free survival between radiotherapy and transoral laser surgery was shown (OR 0.73, (CI95% [0.39 -1.35])) [168]. In a prospective observational study, Motta et al. reported 5-year recurrence-free overall survival rates for supraglottic T1 tumors of 91% and 82%, and for T2 tumors of 88% and 63%, respectively.

Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 57 Patients, 85% of T2 patients and 94% of T3 patients [182]. In a prospective observational study of 24 patients with T3 supraglottic carcinomas, Pantazis et al. determined a 5-year disease- specific survival of 91.7% and a laryngeal preservation of 91.7% [183]. In a retrospective observational study of 43 patients with supraglottic carcinomas (23 stage I–II and 20 stage III– IV), Breda et al. reported a laryngeal preservation of 90.7% [184]. In conclusion, it is stated that T1/T2 carcinomas of the subglottis are very rare and, due to their particularly aggressive nature, laryngectomy is generally recommended.

The 5-year survival rates achieved in patients with stage III-IV (M0) disease are less than 40% [202]. The combination options and the temporal sequence of the individual therapy modalities have led to the development of various treatment strategies for advanced laryngeal carcinoma: I. Surgery + adjuvant radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy II. Primary radiochemotherapy, possibly followed by salvage surgery III. Induction chemotherapy + surgery/radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy IV. EGF receptor inhibitors combined with radiotherapy/ chemoradiotherapy The treatment strategies mentioned above each have their own specific advantages and disadvantages. Before treatment begins, the best possible concept for each patient should be determined in an interdisciplinary dialogue. The following decision-making scheme shows Figure 3 : © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 61 Figure 3: Overview of standards of treatment for laryngeal carcinoma [198] In the case of non-resectable tumors, simultaneous radiochemotherapy is considered the standard of care if the patient's general condition allows it. Simultaneous radiochemotherapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region has been compared with radiotherapy alone in more than 90 randomized studies. In the meta-analysis of these studies, which were published between 1963 and 2000, a significant absolute survival advantage of 6.5% was shown after 5 years with simultaneous radiochemotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone [185]. In individual studies, significantly higher survival benefits of up to 21% were reported [203, 204]. In a meta-analysis by Budach et al. [205], which only included studies with cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin and 5-fluorouracil, an extension of the median survival time by 12 months was demonstrated by simultaneous chemotherapy. Blanchard et al. [186] analyzed the results of all studies in a meta-analysis according to tumor location. In the subgroup of laryngeal carcinomas (61 studies with 3,216 patients), a survival advantage of 4.7% in favor of radiochemotherapy was reported after 5 years. The hazard ratio 0.88 (CI 95% 0.80 - 0.96]) did not differ significantly from that of other tumor locations in the head and neck region, so that in general, for locally advanced head and neck tumors, simultaneous radiochemotherapy can be assumed to be advantageous compared to radiotherapy alone. In the studies, mainly cisplatin +/- 5FU, carboplatin +/- 5FU and mitomycin +/- 5FU were used simultaneously with radiotherapy. Since the different chemotherapies have hardly been compared with each other in randomized studies, only indirect comparisons are possible, which suggest that cisplatin +/- 5FU has the highest efficacy [185] and that the effect depends on the cumulative total dose of cisplatin administered during radiotherapy [190]. Currently, the most commonly used treatments are cisplatin 40 mg/m² once a week and cisplatin (100 mg/m² BSA) on days 1, 22 and 43 of radiotherapy. In case of insufficient renal function, mitomycin C + 5FU [191] or carboplatin + 5FU [193] can also be used.

Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 62 In a randomized study, a survival benefit was also observed for the simultaneous application of cetuximab with radiotherapy [194]. In the subgroup of 107 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, the effect of cetuximab was relatively small (hazard ratio 0.87 (CI95% [0.60-1.27]) [199]), so that this therapy should not be used as a priority in laryngeal carcinoma. Background to 7.20. The HPV status of the tumors was not investigated in these studies, so that different benefits of additional chemotherapy on HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors cannot be ruled out. 7.3.1. Special features of radiotherapy in the treatment of Laryngeal carcinoma 7.21. Evidence-based recommendation Recommendation level Radiotherapy should be performed as IMRT. B Level of Evidence [206, 207] 1a Strong consensus: 100% 7.22. Consensus-based recommendation EEC In IMRT, the planning target volumes to be irradiated at different levels can be treated either in the form of a simultaneously integrated boost or in the form of a sequential boost. Strong consensus: 100% With the introduction of 3-dimensional cross-sectional imaging in radiation planning, the precise contouring of target volumes and organs at risk has become possible. Modern linear accelerators in conjunction with highly developed radiation planning programs now enable the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in almost all radio-oncology departments and practices, which enables significantly improved physical dose distributions. Nutting et al. [206] were able to demonstrate in a randomized study on head and neck tumors that IMRT leads to significantly lower acute and chronic xerostomia and subcutaneous fibrosis compared to conventional 3D planned radiotherapy. These advantages were also associated with an improvement in quality of life. However, fatigue syndromes were observed more frequently in the IMRT arm, presumably due to the slightly higher dose in the posterior cranial fossa as a consequence of the differently weighted radiation directions to protect the parotid gland in the IMRT arm of the study. Locoregional tumor control, disease-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different. A systematic © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 63 A review of the available studies confirmed these results [207]. Although only a small proportion of the patients in the IMRT studies had laryngeal carcinoma, it can be assumed that these results are also valid for laryngeal cancer, at least in the case of locally advanced tumors. These data are particularly important for the treatment of carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx, when the possibility of maintaining function must be weighed against a surgical procedure as a differentiation or quality criterion. 7.3.1.1. Fractionation and total dose of radiotherapy 7.23.

The total doses depend on the potential tumor load in the irradiated © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 64 Area. Macroscopic tumors are irradiated with 70-72 Gy, the former tumor bed of the primary tumor or affected lymph nodes in the adjuvant situation with 60-66 Gy (resection <5mm; glottis <1mm) in healthy tissue and lymph nodes with extracapsular tumor growth: 64-66 Gy, all other areas: 60 Gy) and potentially microscopically affected lymph node areas with 50-54 Gy. In primary radiation therapy in particular, therapy intensification through changes in the dose- time concept (shortened total treatment time through acceleration, increasing the total dose through hyperfractionation) has been tested in a series of randomized studies. The meta- analysis [200] of these studies shows that a moderate shortening of the total treatment time from 7 weeks to 5.5-6 weeks while maintaining the total dose leads to significantly improved locoregional tumor control, but no significant prolongation of overall survival. An even greater shortening of the total treatment time to a minimum of 12 days [211] was only feasible at the expense of a significantly reduced total dose (54 Gy), but led to neither an improvement in locoregional tumor control nor in survival. Pure hyperfractionation with escalation of the total dose to 74-80 Gy with 5x per week twice daily irradiation with a single dose of 1.15 -1.20 Gy single dose resulted in a significant improvement in both locoregional tumor control and overall survival compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks with 2 Gy single dose) [200]. Of 6515 patients in the studies on acceleration and hyperfractionation, 2377 patients had laryngeal carcinoma. In the subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis [200], no different effects depending on tumor location could be found. HPV status was not investigated in any of these studies, most of which were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, so the influence of HPV status on the effects of different fractionations is unknown. From the observation that the effects in oropharyngeal carcinomas, which are often HPV-positive, were no different than in laryngeal carcinomas, it can be indirectly concluded that the influence of HPV status is probably small. In almost all fractionation studies, the proportion of laryngeal carcinomas was small. However, there is no reason to assume that the radiobiology of HPV neg. SCCs in the larynx differs from other HPV neg. SCCs in the pharynx/oral cavity. Whether accelerated radiotherapy is superior to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, even in combination with simultaneous chemotherapy, was investigated in two randomized trials [193, 212], in which, however, only 6% and 25% of the patients had laryngeal carcinoma, and 18% and 9% had hypopharyngeal carcinoma, respectively. Both studies found no benefit of accelerated radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy in any of the relevant endpoints. However, in both studies, less chemotherapy was administered during radiotherapy because the total treatment time in the accelerated arms was shortened by one week. The toxicities of the treatments were approximately the same. Both treatment regimens can therefore be regarded as equivalent standard therapies. The protocols for simultaneous radiochemotherapy that are currently best supported by studies are listed below. In two smaller randomized trials [213, 214], purely hyperfractionated radiotherapy with dose escalation to 74 or 80 Gy with or without simultaneous chemotherapy was investigated. In both studies, the additional chemotherapy led to © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 65 a significant improvement in relapse-free survival and, in one study, also a significantly longer overall survival. A direct randomized comparison of hyperfractionated radiotherapy with or without simultaneous chemotherapy is still lacking. In a network meta-analysis [215], a significant survival advantage was found in an indirect comparison for hyperfractionated radiotherapy with dose escalation in combination with simultaneous chemotherapy. Due to the high logistical effort of a 7-week, twice-daily radiation regimen, not least for the patients, and the lack of convincing data, hyperfractionated radiotherapy with dose escalation has hardly been used in practice.

There is a steep dose dependency for postradiogenic laryngeal edema, which can lead to loss of function and possibly chondronecrosis with subsequent laryngectomy. Doses of over 70 Gy in this area are critical [216]. The pharyngooesophageal junction also appears to be particularly vulnerable. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 66 Before starting radiotherapy, the pre-therapeutic tumor extent and cervical lymph node involvement are documented via panendoscopy and CT or MR. Tumor size is a prognostic factor, with local control and thus functional preservation being more favorable for total volumes of less than 80 ml [217, 218]. The clinical target volume (CTV) for high-dose radiation (dose levels see above) includes all clinically and imaging-based (CT/MR) macroscopically detectable tumor locations (primary tumor and affected lymph nodes) with a safety margin of 5-10 mm. When contouring the CTVs for elective radiation (usually 45-54 Gy) of potentially microscopically affected lymph node regions, one should follow the published consensus guidelines [219, 220]. Typically, levels IIA, III and IV are included on both sides, and in cases of clinical involvement of these groups, also IIb and V. Subglottic spread requires inclusion of Level VI, while clear involvement of the posterior oropharyngeal/hypopharyngeal wall also requires inclusion of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Some study groups also use a CTV with an intermediate dose (usually 60 Gy) for lymph node regions with borderline large lymph nodes or a greatly increased number of lymph nodes that are visible on CT but are formally of normal size. The contouring of the organs at risk should also be carried out according to published guidelines [221]. The additional safety margin for the planning target volume (PTV) and the planning organ at risk volume (PRV) depends on the type of mask used for immobilization, the patient's compliance and the type of positioning verification on the linear accelerator. Under optimal conditions, the safety margins can be reduced to a minimum of 3 mm from the respective target volume. If daily positioning checks are not carried out, a safety margin of at least 5 mm for the PTV is preferable. In the case of restless patients or if masks do not fit well despite all efforts, safety margins of up to 1 cm for the PTV are necessary. During physical radiation planning, the PTVs should be recorded as conformally as possible with the best possible dose reduction at the PRVs. The recommendations of ICRU 50 and ICRU 83 should be taken into account. In the case of carcinomas with prelaryngeal or preepiglottic spread or tumors with a distance of less than 5 millimeters between the tumor tissue and the skin, the use of bolus material (5 mm) is advisable in order to avoid underdosing of tumor tissue due to the \"build-up effect\" of high-energy photons. The use of IMRT should be preferred in this case (see above). © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3.

Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 69 Chemotherapy) or induction chemotherapy followed by radio- or radiochemotherapy represents an alternative to primary surgical intervention Background 7.28. The Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group randomized 332 patients with laryngectomy-only laryngeal cancer to either laryngectomy followed by postoperative radiotherapy or induction chemotherapy with 2 cycles of cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil. Patients who responded to induction therapy received an additional cycle of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy alone with 66-76 Gy in conventional fractionation [189]. Background 7.29. With this concept, the larynx could be preserved in 64% of patients. No difference in overall survival was observed. The EORTC tested the same concept in a randomized trial in hypopharyngeal carcinoma for which surgical laryngectomy was indicated [223, 224]. Larynx preservation after 5 years was only achieved in 35% of patients. Survival was equally poor in both arms at 33% after 5 years. In both studies, no significant differences were observed in the acute and late toxicity of both treatment strategies [224]. Background 7.30 and 7.31. In a study of the quality of life of long-term survivors of the Veterans Affairs Study [222], significant advantages were shown for the arm with induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy compared with laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy in terms of mental health (SF-36 mental health domain), head and neck-specific pain (HNQOL-pain score), head and neck-specific emotionality (HNQOL-emotion) and the frequency of depression. In a subsequent study, the RTOG compared, in a 3-arm randomized trial [187, 188], radiotherapy alone (70 Gy), simultaneous radiochemotherapy (70 Gy + 3x 100 mg/m² cisplatin) and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (if there was no response to chemotherapy, laryngectomy +/- radiotherapy) in laryngeal carcinomas that could only be treated surgically by laryngectomy. Larynx preservation was significantly better at 81% after 10 years in the arm with simultaneous radiochemotherapy than after radiotherapy alone (62%) or induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (66%). No significant difference in survival was observed. Significant differences in acute and late toxicity were not initially reported, apart from increased hematotoxicity in the induction chemotherapy arm. However, after simultaneous radiochemotherapy, significantly more deaths not caused by laryngeal carcinoma were observed in the long-term follow-up [188]. There is only speculation about the reason for this observation, but no reliable data. When making a decision, the focus should not only be on organ preservation but also on function, since, for example, in the case of locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma with destruction of large parts of the organ, the functional result after radiochemotherapy may be unsatisfactory due to swallowing disorders caused by a late esophageal inlet stricture or chronic aspiration. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 70 In the previously described RTOG study [187, 188], approximately 15% of patients were affected by late pharyngeal/esophageal and another 15% by late laryngeal grade III/IV adverse events. However, no late functional assessment was performed in this study. Background 7.32. Since there are no adequate randomized clinical trials directly comparing primary chemoradiotherapy versus surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and none are expected in the near future, it is not possible to make a clear scientific decision as to which patients benefit most from which procedure. American registry studies show that T4a laryngeal carcinomas have significantly worse survival rates after chemoradiotherapy compared to primary laryngectomy [225]. However, patients who received primary chemoradiotherapy had significantly higher N categories than those who were primarily treated surgically. Although the authors used propensity adjustments to compensate for this bias in the multivariate analysis as far as possible, the disadvantage for chemoradiotherapy remained statistically significant, so that patients with T4a tumors, especially those with a high tumor burden, may not be the optimal candidates for larynx preservation using chemoradiotherapy. The tumors currently considered ideal for larynx preservation are, without further consideration of tumor biological peculiarities, the larger T3 carcinomas that can no longer be treated by partial resection [226, 227], thus a selected group. Background 7.33 and 7.34. If functional preservation of the larynx is sought by means of induction chemotherapy, a taxane-containing chemotherapy protocol has proven to be advantageous [228, 229]. With high response rates and good selection options, only a few salvage operations are usually necessary. This effect was also confirmed in the DeLOS-II study, although without any additive value of cetuximab for induction for organ preservation and overall survival. In approximately one third of cases after a lack of response to the short induction (1 cycle of TPF/TP and subsequent endoscopic Response assessment) an early laryngectomy was performed before radiation, which led to comparatively low toxicities/complications and a very good 2-year survival rate [198]. Induction therapies are also being modified to use less toxic substances, and 5-FU is being partially replaced. A randomized phase II study showed that cetuximab administered simultaneously with subsequent radiation therapy can achieve equally good results as simultaneous administration of cisplatin, with a different toxicity profile (greater cutaneous toxicity, less hemato- and nephrotoxicity), which may be beneficial for some patients [196]. There is still disagreement among experts as to whether multimodal therapy concepts for laryngeal organ preservation should be considered as a standard therapy as an alternative to laryngectomy or whether they should continue to be carried out primarily in studies. Critics cite the high late toxicity that limits function, the higher non-tumor-related mortality and the comparatively high complication rates if salvage surgery is necessary. Proponents, on the other hand, cite the high rate of organ preservation with adequate patient selection, the possibility of salvage surgery as a curative option and the lack of a survival disadvantage. Careful individual advice for the patient is therefore of particular importance in this situation. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3.

Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 73 7.41. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Postoperative radiotherapy should be started as soon as possible after wound healing and should be completed within a maximum period of 11 weeks after surgery. Strong consensus: 100% If primary laryngectomy is attempted, the possible need for postoperative radio- or radiochemotherapy must be taken into account. Although randomized studies on the effect of postoperative radiotherapy compared to “no adjuvant therapy” are lacking, the results of cohort studies and prospective databases for patients with >pN1 lymph node involvement, extracapsular tumor growth in the lymph nodes (ECE) or with tumor-free surgical resection margins <5mm showed such a clear superiority of adjuvant radiotherapy that randomized studies were not carried out [238-241]. In patients with a particularly high risk of relapse (ECE in the lymph nodes or with tumor-free surgical resection margins <5mm), randomized studies were able to show a clear advantage in terms of locoregional tumor control and overall survival for simultaneous radiochemotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone [235, 242, 243]. In contrast, no randomized study has shown an advantage for adjuvant chemotherapy alone [185]. If postoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy is indicated, it should be started 3-5 weeks after surgery. Several retrospective studies have independently shown that significantly more locoregional relapses are observed with longer intervals until the start of radiotherapy [244-246]. Postoperative radio- or chemoradiotherapy should be administered in pT3 carcinomas and pT4a carcinomas, in carcinomas with narrow or positive resection margins, perineural invasion, vascular invasion (lymphatic vessel invasion and/or venous invasion), in more than one involved lymph node, and in an involved lymph node with extracapsular tumor growth [238-241]. Postoperative radiotherapy should be started as early as possible after wound healing and should be completed within a maximum of 11 weeks after surgery [244-246]. Since the total doses required for adjuvant radiotherapy are not significantly lower than those of primary radiotherapy (66 Gy vs. 70 Gy), the acute and late side effects of adjuvant therapy are only slightly lower than those of primary radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Approximately 35% of patients treated adjuvantly, regardless of whether radiotherapy alone or simultaneous chemoradiotherapy was used, experienced one or more grade III/IV late side effects [234]. A significant proportion of these side effects also include swallowing problems, particularly with accelerated radiotherapy and simultaneous chemoradiotherapy [240]. The median dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles has been shown to be an important predictor of persistent swallowing disorders, with a dose reduction of 10% to the pharyngeal constrictors in the range of 50 -70 Gy increasing the probability © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 74 of such problems by approximately 10% [247]. This observation is of particular importance for patients with an intermediate risk of recurrence (pN1-2 without ECE and primary tumor >5 mm resected in healthy tissue), since in these patients adjuvant radiotherapy alone with 60 Gy in conventional fractionation is sufficient [209, 235-237]. These considerations should be taken into account when deciding which patients are suitable for larynx preservation. If the indication for adjuvant radiochemotherapy is already very likely before a planned laryngectomy, one must expect approximately the same frequency of late effects, including in relation to the ability to swallow, as with primary radiochemotherapy. In patients who are likely to receive only adjuvant radiotherapy, better functional results with regard to swallowing can be expected. In patients for whom adjuvant radiotherapy is not indicated, the best functional results can be expected. In return, however, it must also be pointed out that, for various reasons, salvage surgery is not always possible after primary radiochemotherapy in cases of primary operability. According to current published observations, this is only possible in every second patient. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for multimodal laryngeal organ preservation protocols The following is intended to provide a decision-making aid taking into account the current literature on the indication for multimodal laryngeal organ preservation. The term \"laryngeal organ preservation\" has now been abandoned and the new term \"laryngo-esophageal dysfunction free survival\" has been chosen as the endpoint in future studies [223, 227]. The indication for such protocols has been further narrowed and the focus has been directed to T2 and T3 laryngeal carcinomas. In fact, T2 carcinomas are not laryngectomized in Germany, so the indication will focus on the group of T3 carcinomas that are classified as not partially resectable. 7.3.2.2. Examinations of voice and swallowing function 7.42. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Voice and swallowing function should be examined and documented pre- therapeutically in larynx-preserving therapy. Strong consensus: 100% The early symptom of laryngeal tumors is hoarseness. This is the reason for clinical examination. In the case that larynx-preserving therapy is planned, the function should be determined pre-therapeutically. Videolaryngostroboscopy and a text recording are considered the minimum requirements for documenting the impaired voice function [248]. Documentation of swallowing function is necessary if there is a history of dysphagia. If oral food intake is not impaired, the patient's statement and video endoscopic imaging of the larynx and hypopharynx are sufficient for examination and documentation. A flexible endoscopic swallowing examination (FEES) documents whether retention, penetration or aspiration is present [249-251]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3.

Patients who meet all of the following criteria are in principle suitable for multimodal organ preservation protocols (radiation + taxane- or platinum-based chemotherapy) as an alternative to laryngectomy: • Histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx that can only be resected by laryngectomy (the possibility of organ-preserving partial laryngeal resection should always be intensively examined and weighed up within the framework of existing local expertise): • T3-T4a glottic carcinomas • T2-T4a supraglottic carcinomas that can only be managed by laryngectomy and possibly resection of the base of the tongue • T2-T4a hypopharyngeal carcinomas that can only be managed by laryngectomy (e.g. T2, postcricoidal) and partial hypopharyngeal resection • N-Status: Cervical metastases (N0-N3) must be remediable by standardized surgical procedures • Blood count: leukocytes > 3,500/mm3 or neutrophils > 1,500/mm3, platelets > 80,000/mm3 • Laboratory: adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine and urea not more than 25% above normal range, creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min/1.72 m2; adequate liver function with SGOT, SGPT not more than 50% and bilirubin not above normal range; electrolytes within normal range • Anaesthesia risk normal to slightly increased • Willingness to undergo salvage surgery if there is no response • Possibility and willingness to undergo close tumor follow-up • In principle no age restriction Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for multimodal organ preservation protocols: • Primary tumor can be treated by larynx-preserving surgical procedures • Distant metastases (M1 status) • Primary tumor volume greater than 14 ml and total tumor volume greater than 80 ml or laryngeal skeleton breached with infiltration of the surrounding soft tissues or the esophageal entrance (cartilage infiltration alone is not an exclusion criterion) • Tumor-specific pretreatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy • Life expectancy less than 3 months • Karnofsky performance status < 60% • acute infections or fever • known HIV infection or other immunosuppression • severe cardiopulmonary concomitant diseases (heart failure grade III and IV according to NYHA status, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, global respiratory failure) • Chronic diseases requiring long-term therapy (uncontrolled diabetes, active rheumatoid arthritis) • Expected lack of patient compliance © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 76 • regular follow-up not possible • Pregnancy or breastfeeding In principle, organ preservation protocols should currently only be used in exceptional cases outside of studies due to the many unanswered questions. The early good response to induction chemotherapy has proven to be advantageous for the successful selection of suitable patients [198, 252]. 7.3.3. Late toxicity Simultaneous chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma is often used as an alternative to laryngectomy with the aim of organ and function preservation. The treatment results in terms of local tumor control and survival are good. However, both acute and late toxicity are pronounced. The publication on the so-called \"T-score relative risk scale\" by Trotti [253] impressively shows how acute toxicity has increased over the last decades due to dose and modality intensification. The observed acute toxicity has increased fivefold from normal fractionated adjuvant radiation to hyperfractionated radiochemotherapy [253]. The direct comparison of the side effects of individual procedures is made difficult by the fact that there is no uniform classification and documentation of side effects across all studies and that the incidence of late side effects increases with the follow-up period. Often, not all cofactors are adequately documented and presented in studies. Late toxicity manifests itself primarily in persistent, progressive dysphagia with aspiration, which may occur more than 5 years after completion of therapy. Dysphagia may be caused by the formation of strictures as a result of radiation-induced mucosal ulceration or by impaired motility due to radiation-induced, progressive fibrosis of the pharyngeal muscles. In an analysis of all RTOG studies with simultaneous radiochemotherapy of advanced head and neck tumors, tumor location in the larynx/hypopharynx, tumor size, and neck dissection after definitive radiotherapy were risk factors for severe long-term toxicity in decreasing order of importance [254]. Swallowing disorders and laryngeal problems accounted for 75% of late effects and were found in a good 30% of patients in the simultaneous radiochemotherapy arm of the US study on larynx preservation (RTOG-9111) [187]. Dysphagia can often result in silent aspiration and subsequent late pulmonary complications. The prevalence is underestimated because silent aspiration can only be diagnosed by radiological (contrast medium passage) or endoscopic (FEES) procedures [250]. Dysphagia can occur after both simultaneous chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy and is essentially dependent on the radiation dose applied to the constrictors [255]. Adequate swallowing rehabilitation in an interdisciplinary team can improve swallowing function, reduce aspiration and improve the quality of life of affected patients. Fibrosis of the neck muscles, late edema in the entire larynx [216], neuropathies and scarring of the mucosa contribute to a slowly increasing dysphagia over several months with possible latent aspiration, which in some © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.3. Fundamental considerations of multimodal therapy approaches 77 cases may lead to permanent tracheostomy and the wearing of a blocked tracheostomy tube [256-258]. In the 10-year data from the RTOG-9111 [188] laryngeal organ preservation study discussed above, it was also apparent that the rate of late, non-tumor-related deaths in the simultaneous arm was 36% compared to the other two arms (18% each). Due to the equivalence of the two combination arms (simultaneous and sequential) in terms of the endpoint “laryngectomy free survival”, this led to an ongoing discussion about the toxicity- related advantages of an induction protocol for laryngeal organ preservation. Even if the exact causes remain unclear, the increased non-tumor-related death rate in the simultaneous arm is associated with the higher toxicity of the therapy. David Rosenthal from MD Anderson presented a retrospective, very extensive monocentric study in which he divided the 221 T4a laryngeal carcinomas from 1983 to 2011 into the group of patients who underwent primary surgery (n=161) and those who underwent primary radiochemotherapy (n=60) and compared them taking numerous parameters into account. With the same median survival in both groups, 45% of the patients who were treated conservatively had a permanent tracheostomy and an “any event” aspiration rate of 23%. The rate of grade III/IV late dysphagia was significantly lower in the group of patients who underwent primary surgery. It is noteworthy that when considering the endpoint “laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival” defined by Ang and Lefebvre, only 15% met this target criterion after 10 years (after 5 years, the figure was 35%). For the endpoint “actuarial freedom from laryngectomy”, i.e. the pure consideration “with or without salvage laryngectomy”, 70% was achieved (after 5 years, 70% unchanged). The gradual deterioration in functionality observed here, which lasted for many years, was impressively documented here. The authors conclude that, for reasons of late toxicity and overall survival, laryngectomy is the treatment of choice for T4 laryngeal carcinomas and that multimodal organ preservation only appears justified in selected smaller T4 tumors with only minimal involvement of the thyroid cartilage [259-261]. Therapeutic options in case of late toxicity The range of therapeutic options is currently limited. Rosenthal, Lewin and Eisbruch [262] propose special care protocols in a study to reduce the occurrence of chronic dysphagia and aspiration. Their approach includes close recording of swallowing difficulties and early speech therapy interventions during and after therapy in order to optimize long-term function [251, 263]. However, this requires a basic understanding of the functionality of the swallowing act, accompanying qualified functional diagnostics (phoniatrics and ENT) and interdisciplinary therapy concepts. In particular, ongoing swallowing training during and after therapy (Cave: prophylactic PEG placement) and early rehabilitation are said to be crucial for success [262, 264, 265]. Finally, it should be noted that the cited studies are based on now outdated radiation techniques, so that the late functionalities currently achievable with IMRT and parotid/ constrictor protection should be less pronounced. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.4.

Consensus-based statement EEC Preservation of the accessory nerve during neck dissection leads to an improvement in quality of life Strong consensus: 100% The metastasis rate of laryngeal carcinomas depends on the location and extent of the tumor. Glottic carcinomas, especially at an early stage, metastasize extremely rarely. In contrast, supraglottic carcinomas often show early lymphogenous metastasis. Subglottic carcinomas can also cause metastases relatively early, but these usually affect the paratracheal lymph nodes. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in head and neck oncology to reduce the morbidity associated with neck dissection while at the same time achieving optimal oncological results (selective neck dissection, in which the addressed levels are indicated). It should be noted that in clinical cN0 necks, occult metastases can occur in up to 40% of cases, depending on the T category [89, 90]. Despite intensive efforts to establish image morphological criteria in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or B-mode sonography in order to reliably identify lymph node metastases, the aforementioned procedures still lack sufficient sensitivity [266]. The sensitivity for detecting cervical metastases is in the range of 70-80% for sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and PET/CT [266, 267]. The PETNECK study by Mehanna was able to answer the question of whether elective neck dissection should be performed prior to primary radiochemotherapy if neck lymph node metastases are suspected. The randomized controlled study was able to show that elective subsequent neck dissection is not necessary if PET-CT is negative following RCH (the predictive value of a negative PET-CT is very high at 98.1%), even if there were indications of neck lymph node metastases in the pre-therapeutic staging (level 1 evidence). This enabled 80% of elective neck dissections to be saved in the PET-CT surveillance arm of the study [114]. The study results have changed diagnostic standards worldwide and were codified in Germany by the GBA in a new indication guideline for PET-CT in 2017. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.4. Neck dissection 79 In neck dissection, a distinction is made between elective (prophylactic in cN0 situations) and curative neck dissection (in cN+ situations). The surgical extent of neck dissection is classified according to Robbins [74]: • Radical neck dissection (RND): Resection level IV including resection of the internal jugular vein (VJI), the sternocleidomastoid muscle (M.SCCM) and the accessory nerve • Modified radical neck dissection (mRND) = functional ND: resection of level IV; preservation of one or more non-lymphatic structures of the RND (mRND type 1-3) • Selective neck dissection (SND) Preservation of one or more LN levels of the RND; Preservation of the VJI, M.SCM and N.accessorius (new: SND I-III old: supraomohyoid SND) • Extended neck dissection SND is the most frequently recommended and performed form of neck dissection today [268]. 7.4.1.

Consensus-based recommendation EEC If adjuvant radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy of the contralateral lymphatic drainage pathways is indicated after surgical treatment of an N+ laryngeal carcinoma, neck dissection of the contralateral cN0- neck should be avoided. Strong consensus: 95.65% Glottic carcinomas, for example, have a relatively low probability of metastasis, whereas the risk of occult lymph node metastases in supraglottic and subglottic laryngeal carcinomas is considered to be comparatively high [89, 269, 271-282]. In some cases, there is also a risk of contralateral metastasis, especially if the tumor has grown close to the midline or has crossed it. The procedure of choice here is neck dissection [74] with removal of the neck lymph node levels IIa, III, and IV. The indication for elective neck dissection, which should be considered in cases of histopathologically proven laryngeal carcinomas and in cases of unremarkable neck lymph node status (cN0) in imaging (CT/MRI), must be strictly dependent on the tumor location and tumor category [268, 276, 283, 284]. If primary radiotherapy of laryngeal carcinoma is performed, there is no indication for prior elective neck dissection of the N0 neck. In the case of T1 glottic carcinomas, elective neck dissection is not necessary in cN0 situations. In the case of T2 glottic carcinomas, elective neck dissection should be considered in cN0 situations due to the possibility of up to 7% occult lymph node metastases [89]. However, there is evidence that elective neck dissection does not provide any survival benefit in the case of T2 glottic carcinoma [285]. In the case of T3 carcinomas that have spread beyond the glottic area to the supra- or subglottic region, an ipsilateral neck dissection is recommended in the case of unilateral tumor manifestation, and a bilateral neck dissection of levels IIa to IV is recommended in the case of tumors that cross the midline. In the case of supraglottic carcinomas, the probability of metastasis is significantly higher than in the case of glottic carcinoma, so that elective neck dissection is indicated in any case (see chapter7.7 ) [114]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.4.

B Level of Evidence [114] 1b Strong consensus: 100% The decision for an elective neck dissection in rescue surgery of the larynx depends primarily on whether the neck vessel sheaths were also irradiated. If the lymphatic drainage area was included in the irradiation, there is usually no compelling indication for elective neck dissection regardless of the T category of the primary tumor. If the lymphatic drainage area was not included in the irradiation (e.g. small-field irradiation), the procedure should be similar to that for primary surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinoma (see above). On the question of elective neck dissection after primary radiochemotherapy, Mehanna et al. [114] presented the study already presented, which showed that elective neck dissection can be dispensed with if PET-CT after radiochemotherapy is negative. After primary radio- or radiochemotherapy, however, a neck dissection should only be performed if PET-positive lymph nodes are still detected 10-12 weeks after completion of therapy (see chapter7.7 ) [114]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.5.

Strong consensus: 100% If pre-therapeutic clinical and radiological diagnostics indicate a high probability of lymph node metastasis, its treatment must be included in the overall concept. The treatment of the N+ neck, however, is less controversial than the treatment of the N0 neck. Depending on the extent and location of the metastases, ipsilateral selective, modified radical or radical neck dissection is performed [74]. In the case of fixed Patients with neck lymph node metastases or N3 metastases should undergo a modified radical or radical neck dissection of the ipsilateral side. The contralateral side of the neck should also be included in the treatment concept.

Reconstructive surgery after partial laryngectomy and laryngopharyngectomy 83 7.54. Consensus-based recommendation EEC The aim of the surgical procedure should be an R0 resection. If an R0 resection does not appear possible, primary surgical treatment should not be performed. In case of R1, re-resection should be attempted. Consensus: 95% Transoral laser surgical resection of T3 tumors with fixed vocal cords and/or with infiltration of the postcricoid area, the preepiglottic tissue and/or slight erosion of the thyroid cartilage (inner cortex) should only be performed in exceptional cases and by particularly experienced surgeons. In the case of T4a tumors with infiltration through the thyroid cartilage and/or spread outside the larynx, the indication for transoral resection is exceeded. Open transcervical partial resections offer the advantage over transoral laser surgical tumor resection of being able to restore the anatomy and functions of the larynx with the help of reconstructive surgical procedures, in addition to better overview and accessibility. In order to fully meet these goals after partial laryngectomy, however, a targeted patient selection is necessary. The general condition, age, motivation of the patient in the long term Tolerating functional disorders and cognitive abilities play a decisive role. Due to the described indication limitations for transoral laser surgery and transcervical partial resections, complete organ resection still represents a reasonable surgical treatment option for T3 and T4 tumors of the larynx. As a rule, resections of squamous cell carcinomas are performed under microscopic control using intraoperative frozen sections. A postoperative R1 situation that nevertheless occurs can have the following causes: • The secondary processing (after paraffin embedding) of the frozen sections subsequently detects tumor cells not detected in the frozen section • The additional control of the cutting edges of the tumor specimen subsequently detects a positive cutting edge that was not secured by a frozen section • Tumor resection was performed with marginal incisions without frozen sections • Despite preoperative assessment, intraoperatively it becomes apparent that the surgical technical possibilities for an R0 resection have been exceeded In the latter case, the question of re-resection is superfluous. In this case, the region of remaining tumor remnants should be marked intraoperatively for subsequent radiotherapy (eg with vascular clips). In the remaining cases of an R1 situation, a re-resection is absolutely necessary. In this case, the difficulty is always to remove the remaining © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.6. Resection techniques 84 macroscopically invisible tumor residues can be localized when healing processes with scarring have already begun. Therefore, during primary tumor resection, precise marking of the tumor borders and a detailed description of the frozen sections are essential for spatial allocation in the event of a recurrence. If the non-tumor-free edge can be identified, a follow-up resection must be performed immediately. The tumor area and adjacent tissue should be generously removed and a sample taken from the edge should also be taken. On both resection specimens, marking the edge near or far from the tumor is helpful for histomorphological processing. Since the current study situation does not allow any valid conclusions to be drawn about an adequate level of safety margins, the recommendations for further action in the case of R0 classification and a small safety margin of less than 1 mm are based on experience and vary. Three options for the postoperative procedure are described: • Re-resection or histomorphological mapping • “Wait and see” • Postoperative radiation R0 resections of advanced tumors (T3/T4a) with very narrow resection margins (less than 1 mm) should be treated and resected like R1 resections. In the case of R0 resections of small (T1/T2) vocal cord tumors with narrow resection margins, immediate endoscopic mapping can be performed instead of a resection. Representative biopsies in the immediate vicinity of the former tumor region must confirm the resection in healthy tissue. Otherwise, a resection must be performed. Alternatively, a “wait and see” strategy is possible. The resection area must be clinically monitored closely (every 2-3 months) using indirect laryngoscopy. If clinical suspicion exists, a biopsy should be performed, followed by re-resection if confirmed. If a repeat operation is not possible or not desired, the patient should be recommended radiotherapy as an alternative. Reconstructive procedures of the larynx are necessary when parts of the larynx remain after tumor resection, but in the case of primary closure, these can lead to significant functional impairments of breathing and voice production and to disruption of swallowing function. 7.6. Resection techniques Transcervical both vertical and horizontal partial laryngectomy lead to characteristic functional impairments. While vertical partial laryngeal resections primarily cause impairments of the While partial horizontal resections generally lead to disturbances in the closure mechanisms during swallowing and thus to aspiration, swallowing disorders only occur after partial vertical resections if © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.6. Resection techniques 85 at least one arytenoid cartilage must be removed, such as in a hemi-, three- quarter-laryngectomy or a subtotal laryngectomy. T1 and T2 tumors Reconstructions are generally not necessary after these resections, especially in the case of T1 and T2 tumors. In exceptional cases, pedicled ventricular fold flaps can be transposed as abutments for the remaining vocal cord. In the case of larger thyroid cartilage defects, parts of the hyoid bone or epiglottis can be used to stabilize the laryngeal skeleton. Vertical partial resections (T3 and T4a) In the classic hemilaryngectomy according to HAUTANT, the cricoid cartilage is completely preserved. The vocal cord and ventricular fold of one side and half of the epiglottis and thyroid cartilage are resected. To restore aspiration-free swallowing and to generate the primary vocal sound, the cricoid cartilage plate must be raised so that the vocal cord of the remaining side of the larynx has a support for phonation and to close off the upper airway during swallowing. To do this, costal cartilage transplants or parts of the hyoid bone of the affected side can be sewn onto the cricoid cartilage plate at the infrahyoid muscles (pedicled or isolated). The reconstructed vocal cord and ventricular cord can then be covered with mucous membrane from the medial wall of the piriform sinus and the postcricoid region. In the case of more extensive partial resections such as three-quarter laryngectomy or subtotal laryngectomy (according to PEARSON), restoration of aspiration-free swallowing is unlikely even with microvascular tissue transfer. Tracheostomy-free breathing is also generally not possible with the \"voice shunt\" reconstructed from remnants of the larynx. This extremely limited function of the \"voice shunt\" is further endangered by the consequences of the necessary oncological follow-up treatment (radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy). Horizontal partial resections There are basically two procedures, the classic horizontal partial resection according to ALONSO and the supracricoid partial resection. Both procedures have in common the infrahyoid approach and closure by pulling up the remaining larynx. In the ALONSO partial resection, the part of the larynx above the vocal cord level (ventricular ligaments, epiglottis, upper third of the thyroid cartilage on both sides) is removed. This preserves the production of the primary vocal sound and the glottis closure (first closure mechanism) to protect the airways. However, due to the loss of the epiglottis, the second closure mechanism to prevent aspiration, the closure of the laryngeal entrance, is no longer possible in the original way. If the hyoid bone is released caudally to close the defect, there is usually a persistent risk of aspiration. If, however, the pexy with pulling the glottic level up to the level of the non-released hyoid bone is successful, the base of the tongue completely and reliably covers the glottic level when swallowing. All partial laryngeal resections require the preserved function of at least the contralateral superior laryngeal nerve, which is also used in the © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.6. Resection techniques 86 The epiglottis with preepiglottic fatty tissue and the cranial half of the thyroid cartilage can be resected without permanent loss of function. However, the indication for horizontal partial resection according to Alonso has been almost completely replaced by transoral laser surgery [286]. The prerequisite for this is complete transoral adjustment of the larynx and limitation of the tumor to the endolarynx. If parts of the base of the tongue also have to be resected due to the extent of the tumor, the likelihood of a long-term swallowing disorder increases significantly. In these cases, the base of the tongue must be reconstructed to protect against aspiration. The transposition of infrahyoid muscle flaps on both sides can be used for this purpose. A frequently used alternative for reconstructing the base of the tongue to the horizontally partially resected larynx is the microvascularized forearm flap. The strength of the supracricoid partial resection lies in the extent of the resection. It allows the removal of the entire thyroid cartilage with the complete supraglottis and almost the entire glottis, while preserving only a mobile arytenoid cartilage, the hyoid and the cricoid cartilage under orthograde supervision and with an excellent overview. During tumor excision, the epiglottis can be resected (CHP) or its cranial part can be preserved (CHEP), depending on the extent of the tumor. The possible subglottic extent of the tumor is 1–1.5 cm [287] or is defined by a sufficient distance to the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage. Supracricoid partial resection complements the options for surgical laryngeal preservation in critical indications with a highly standardized and reproducible surgical technique with significant postoperative morbidity due to the high demands of swallowing rehabilitation and limited vocal function, but excellent oncological results in selected patients with category T3 laryngeal carcinoma [286, 288]. If the patients are properly selected, supracricoid partial laryngeal resection offers a significant functional advantage over laryngectomy with voice prosthesis. Transcervical laryngeal and hypopharyngeal partial resection These resections are exceptional situations with strict indications because they can result in a lengthy rehabilitation phase of months to years for the affected patients. In the case of unilateral transglottic laryngeal tumors, a hemilaryngectomy is combined with a partial resection of the hypopharynx (medial and/or lateral piriform sinus wall). Depending on the extent of the resection, the laryngeal skeleton can be rebuilt with a costal cartilage transplant and the hypopharynx can be reconstructed with a forearm transplant. The creation of a wide piriform sinus with a thin forearm transplant maintains the flexibility of the reconstructed larynx and thus enables elevation during swallowing. This forward-upward movement of the larynx with simultaneous opening of the esophageal entrance is the prerequisite for aspiration-free food intake [289, 290]. Pharyngolaryngectomy Pharyngolaryngectomy is still part of the therapeutic options for advanced carcinomas, e.g. as a salvage procedure or as primary therapy. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.7. Residual tumor, recurrence and recurrent metastasis 87 Stages. Complete organ resection generally requires reconstruction of the esophagus. The first choice method for this is a forearm transplant. It is important to plan the transplant to be wide enough to be able to model the widest possible tube. To prevent postoperative stenosis, the lower anastomosis with the esophageal entrance should be dissolved by triangular exchange. Another variant of stenosis prophylaxis with simultaneous formation of a very wide neohypopharynx was described by Bootz et al. [291]. The forearm transplant is sewn with the longitudinal edges in a U-shape onto the prevertebral fascia. This reduces shrinkage and stenosis to a minimum. Alternatively, reconstruction can also be carried out using pedicled flaps. This is recommended in cases of poor vascular positioning, extensive resection and as part of salvager resections after primary radiochemotherapy. Voice rehabilitation is carried out with voice prostheses that are placed below the caudal anastomosis in the anterior wall of the esophagus. An alternative to voice rehabilitation that is now only used very rarely is the construction of a speech siphon with simultaneous reconstruction of the esophagus from extra-long jejunal segments and was also described by Remmert et al. [292, 293]. Because of the necessary abdominal surgery, the procedure is primarily suitable for younger patients and has the advantage of a very short rehabilitation period of just a few weeks to regain swallowing and voice function. 7.7.

In March 2017, the Federal Joint Committee announced the change in the guideline on methods of statutory health insurance care using positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for head and neck tumors [294]. The primary study endpoint was overall survival. 37 centers in Great Britain were involved. The study population consisted of 564 patients with stage N2 and N3 head and neck tumors and no evidence of distant metastases. These were randomized into 2 groups (surveillance group (subgroup n=18 laryngeal carcinomas), planned neck dissection group (subgroup n=19 laryngeal carcinomas)) of 282 patients each. Both groups were comparable. In the surveillance group, neck dissection was performed depending on the FDG-PET-CT findings 3 months after completion of radiochemotherapy. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.7. Residual tumor, recurrence and recurrent metastasis 89 For this purpose, the following qualitative criteria were used 12 weeks after chemoradiotherapy: • Incomplete nodal response – intense focal FDG uptake with or without cervical lymph node enlargement, • Questionable (doubtful) nodal response to therapy – low or no focal FDG uptake in enlarged neck lymph nodes or low uptake in normal-sized neck lymph nodes, • Complete nodal response to therapy – all unremarkable FDG-PET-CT findings. In the planned neck dissection group, the operation was performed regularly. The median follow-up interval was 36 months. Fewer neck dissections were performed in the FDG-PET-CT based surveillance group compared to the planned neck dissection group (54 versus 221). The surgical complication rate was almost the same in both groups (42% versus 38%). The 2-year overall survival rate was 84.9% (CI95% [80.7-89.1]) in the surveillance group and 81.5% (CI95% [76.9-86.3]) in the planned neck dissection group. The non-inferiority of FDG-PET-CT surveillance compared to planned neck dissection was statistically significant (p=0.004). The Mehanna study [114] also showed that the surveillance group had a small advantage in general health status (EORTC QLQ-C30) 6 months after randomization compared to the neck dissection group. However, this difference became significantly smaller after 12 months, so that there was finally no difference between the two groups (p=0.85). If a tumor manifests again after a tumor-free interval following surgery and/or radiochemotherapy, this is referred to as a recurrence, in contrast to a residual tumor, in which a residual tumor remains despite therapy. The previous therapy is of crucial importance for further therapy planning. Residual and recurrent tumors of the larynx after radiotherapy have already taken place are a serious clinical problem. They usually show aggressive growth, unpredictable lymphogenous metastasis and are associated with poor local control. Residual tumors and recurrent tumors after previous surgical therapy, on the other hand, are less problematic, since both a further surgical treatment, possibly combined with adjuvant radiochemotherapy, and radiochemotherapy alone are possible. Salvage surgery is used when a residual tumor exists after primary radiochemotherapy. This can affect both the primary tumor region and the neck lymph node metastases. The time until a recurrence occurs depends not only on the tumor biology, but also on various parameters of the primary therapy, such as the radiation dose. The majority of recurrences occur within the first two years after primary treatment; recurrences that occur in the first 10 months after primary treatment are associated with a particularly poor prognosis [6]. Curative treatment options for recurrences and residues after primary radio(chemo)therapy include laryngectomy, open partial laryngeal resection and transoral (laser) surgery, with laryngectomy being the most frequently used treatment worldwide in the recurrence situation [295]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.7. Residual tumor, recurrence and recurrent metastasis 90 Over 70% of patients with a residue or recurrence after unsuccessful radiochemotherapy have advanced tumors and almost half of the patients have transglottic T3 or T4 tumors [296]. In this situation, imaging and endoscopy often lead to an incorrect assessment of the tumor size in the sense of \"understaging\", since the assessment of the tissue is considerably more difficult due to post-radiogenic edema and scarring. Pretherapeutic clinical examination and imaging only have an accuracy of about 50% in the case of recurrence, with up to 90% of recurring tumors being estimated as too small [256]. In addition, recurring tumors often show multicentric tumor foci that may exceed the limits of the primary tumor size. In a retrospective analysis of 173 patients with tumor recurrences after radiotherapy of early glottic carcinomas, a comparison with the initial T category of the primary tumor showed that 61% of the recurrences had a higher rT category, 31% of the recurrences had the same rT category as the primary tumor, and only 8% had a lower rT category in the sense of down-staging [297]. For this reason, in the recurrence situation after primary radio(chemo)therapy, resection at least in the original tumor borders is usually advisable. Successful management in the recurrence situation depends on strict selection criteria. In particular, when planning transoral surgery and open partial laryngeal resections, a careful assessment of the location, growth and extent of the recurrence tumor should be carried out. An R0 resection is also of considerable prognostic value in the recurrence situation and should be the primary goal of the surgical procedure [298]. In the available studies, disease-free survival in an average observation period of 38 months after transoral laser therapy for recurrences after primary radio(chemo)therapy is between 43% and 90% [299]. Data on local control after a single transoral laser therapy in the recurrence situation vary in the literature between 38% and 85% [6, 300]. Repeated laser surgical resections in the case of recurrence after previous radiotherapy are possible and can improve local control, as shown by Steiner et al., who were able to increase local control from an initial 38% to 71% through repeated laser surgical resection. Other authors report local control rates of 50% to 82% after multiple laser resections in the case of recurrence after primary radio(chemo)therapy [301]. On the other hand, Roedel et al. In case of recurrence after transoral laser surgery, early laryngectomy should be considered, as local control after repeated transoral surgery is unfavorable [302]. There is a meta-analysis of retrospective case series on transoral laser surgery after primary radio(chemo)therapy from 2014 [303]. Only one of the included studies was a case series with exclusively prospective inclusion of cases. The pooled estimate of the 2-year overall survival after transoral laser therapy in the recurrence situation was 74.8%. Larynx preservation was achieved in 72.3% of patients. The local control of the total of 286 patients was 56.9% after one laser surgery procedure, 63.8% after multiple laser surgery procedures, and 88.2% after salvage laryngectomy. Based on the available limited evidence, it can be concluded that transoral laser surgery in the recurrence situation after prior radiation should only be offered in carefully selected cases. This should be done in centers that have a high level of expertise in transoral laser surgery and, if possible, also offer open © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.7. Residual tumor, recurrence and recurrent metastasis 91 Offer partial resections so that the optimal treatment option can be selected in each individual case. There are some publications on the safety of open partial laryngeal resection in the residual or recurrent situation after primary chemoradiotherapy in terms of local tumor control, overall survival, and postoperative voice and swallowing function [304-314]. However, the performance of open partial laryngeal resection in the recurrent situation is not widespread and is not practiced in many countries. However, patients who are candidates for partial laryngeal resection must have good lung function and few comorbidities and must have been enabled to make an informed decision, as swallowing rehabilitation may be lengthy [315, 316]. Salvage laryngectomy after primary radio(chemo)therapy is often the only curative treatment option for patients with advanced laryngeal carcinoma and is an integral part of the multimodal treatment of advanced laryngeal carcinoma. Salvage laryngectomy is characterized by more difficult intraoperative preparation, as radiotherapy leads to scarring and reduced blood flow to the tissue. There is therefore a significantly higher postoperative complication rate, which is primarily characterized by impaired wound healing, lymphedema and the formation of salivary fistulas [317-320]. Pharyngocutaneous fistula is the most common surgical complication in the postoperative phase after total laryngectomy, particularly in the salvage situation but also in the recurrence situation after previous radiochemotherapy [321]. According to one of the most comprehensive retrospective analyses by van Putten et al. [322] The complication rate of salvage laryngectomy after primary radiochemotherapy is significantly increased (64%; 14% major, 54% minor complications). Of 60 patients with recurrences, only 22 patients underwent salvage surgery. In 38 patients, there were absolute contraindications to salvage surgery after primary radiochemotherapy. Pharyngocutaneous fistulas are associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and increased costs and predispose to vascular erosion [323-325]. The incidence after laryngectomy varies in different studies from 3% to 65% [326]. The development of pharyngocutaneous fistulas is a multifactorial process, with patients who have received primary radio(chemo)therapy being a particular risk group. Identification of high-risk patients is crucial to potentially reduce the risk of fistulas through perioperative measures. Flap placement during salvage laryngectomy may be recommended to prevent pharyngocutaneous fistulas. There is no consensus in the literature about which tissue transfer is optimal. Here, too, almost exclusively retrospective cohort studies are available. Most studies are on the pectoralis major flap [324, 325]. A few studies compare two different flap techniques [325, 327]. In a retrospective cohort analysis of 359 patients with pharyngeal fistulas after salvage laryngectomy, it was shown that the fistula rate after reconstruction using a pectoralis major flap (15%) was significantly lower than after reconstruction using a free flap (25%) or primary wound closure (34%). In patients who developed a fistula, the persistence of the fistula was significantly longer with primary closure (14 weeks) compared with reconstruction using a pectoralis major flap (9 weeks) or free flap (6.5 weeks) [325]. It can therefore be concluded that in the context of salvage laryngectomy, the introduction of tissue from the non- © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.7. Residual tumor, recurrence and recurrent metastasis 92 irradiated area can significantly reduce the risk of fistulas, although there is no evidence regarding the type of tissue transfer [325, 328-331]. From numerous recent reports, we now know that a laryngeal carcinoma that is in principle resectable after primary chemoradiotherapy does not necessarily have to be salvage operable. According to new reports, only less than half of the previously resectable tumors turned out to be no longer resectable/operable after chemoradiotherapy [322]. Repeated radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy is often offered if the recurrence is unresectable and there is no other option for curative treatment. In numerous smaller studies with selected patients, 5-year survival rates of between 9 and 20% and local tumor control rates of 11-48% were described [332-335]. Tumor control was significantly better when the second radiation treatment was administered with more than 50 Gy [333-335]. The local side effects on healthy tissue are associated with serious late radiation damage in 9-18% [334, 336, 337]. In large case series, fibrosis of the neck muscles, oral mucosal necrosis in 41%, trismus in 30% and fatal complications in 11% were described after a second radiation treatment [332]. Severe acute radiation toxicity is more likely in patients over 80 years of age, especially after second irradiation to the neck [337]. There is evidence that IMRT may help improve the therapeutic index of second irradiation [334]. If a lymph node metastasis occurs after therapy or if there is a residual lymph node metastasis, the same therapeutic indications apply as for the primary tumor. When considering resectability, the topographical relationship of the metastasis to the large blood vessels (carotid artery), the skull base and the upper thoracic aperture must be taken into account. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.8. Functionality and quality of life 93 7.8. Functionality and quality of life 7.60. Consensus-based statement EEC Differences in voice quality after TLM (transoral laser microsurgery) and primary radiotherapy of T2 glottic cancer cannot be evaluated due to a lack of studies. Strong consensus: 100% The functionality and quality of life of early laryngeal carcinoma depends largely on the quality of the voice. The additional relevant aspects of dysphagia, aspiration and respiratory impairment in advanced tumors are not present here [6]. Functionality/voice quality The quality of the voice after partial resection of the larynx depends on how much tissue was resected in the area of the vocal folds, but also on whether other areas of the larynx can function as a replacement glottis postoperatively. The quality of the voice can therefore vary considerably between patients despite similar surgical procedures. The voice quality of patients after transoral laser surgery is analyzed in the literature using both subjective patient-based instruments and objective examiner-based methods. The use of different measurement instruments in different studies makes it difficult to compare the results [6]. There is a prospective randomized controlled study from Finland on voice quality after transoral laser surgery and radiotherapy for T1aN0M0 vocal cord carcinomas [338]. The study analyzed the voice quality of 56 patients who were randomized to two groups: transoral laser surgery and radiotherapy of 66Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy over 6.5 weeks. Voice quality was assessed using the GRBAS scale (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain), videostroboscopy, and patient self-assessment at baseline and 6 and 24 months after treatment. Voice quality after therapy was assessed similarly in both groups, but patients after transoral laser therapy had a more breathy voice and more frequently had incomplete vocal cord closure. Patients who received radiotherapy also reported less discomfort in daily life due to hoarseness after 24 months. The authors conclude that primary radiotherapy may be the treatment of choice for patients with high demands on good voice quality. Three systematic reviews of retrospective analyses examined voice quality after transoral laser therapy versus radiotherapy of T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas. Spielmann et al. [339] analyzed results from 15 observational studies on voice quality after therapy of T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas in a systematic review. In twelve studies, no significant difference in voice quality was found, three of the included studies reported © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.8. Functionality and quality of life 94 better results after radiotherapy. Feng et al. [170] examined 293 patients with T1 and T2 glottic carcinomas from 6 studies with regard to the post-therapeutic Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Three studies reported no difference in the VHI between radiotherapy and laser therapy, in two studies the values were significantly lower after radiotherapy, in one study significantly higher. In the most recent systematic review of T1 vocal cord carcinomas from 2012 by Yoo et al. there is evidence that radiotherapy may be associated with fewer measurable disturbances in voice quality compared to surgery, but no significant differences in the subjective patient perception were found [167]. In summary, there are currently three meta-analyses of retrospective observational studies comparing voice quality after transoral laser surgery with primary radiotherapy for T1 carcinomas of the glottis [169, 171, 340], and there is also a meta-analysis of T1 and T2 carcinomas [168]. None of these meta-analyses shows a significant difference in voice quality between transoral laser therapy and radiotherapy. However, three meta-analyses show a trend towards better voice quality after radiotherapy [168, 169, 171], and one analysis shows a trend towards better voice quality after laser therapy [6, 340]. The voice quality after vertical partial laryngeal resection depends on the location of the tumor and the surgical method used, as the amount of tissue resected in the area of the vocal folds and the ventricular folds is crucial. On the other hand, it is relevant whether other areas of the larynx can function as a replacement glottis postoperatively or whether surgical reconstruction was performed. Singh et al. [341] were able to show that the voice quality after vertical partial laryngeal resection improves. Partial laryngeal resection differs significantly from healthy subjects and is similar to patients after laryngectomy. As a rule, all patients after vertical partial resection have a more or less pronounced hoarseness [341]. Biacabe et al. [342] were able to show that in 80% of patients with frontolateral partial resection without reconstruction, supraglottic structures are involved in laryngeal closure and voice production. Despite the incomplete closure of the glottis, vertical partial resections are better compensated in terms of swallowing ability than horizontal partial laryngeal resections [343]. The need for a permanent gastrostomy is rare. Permanent tracheotomies and functional laryngectomies are also only occasionally necessary [344]. The functional results after transoral laser surgery for supraglottic laryngeal carcinomas are good; permanent tracheotomies and functional laryngectomies as well as permanent PEG dependency are rare [6]. Ambrosch et al. [178] reported permanent tracheotomies in 2% of a group of 50 patients with T3 supraglottic laryngeal carcinomas. In the studies by Davis et al. [345] and Peretti et al. [346], no patient required a permanent tracheotomy in groups of 46 and 20 patients with supraglottic carcinomas, respectively. The need for permanent nutrition via a gastric tube is reported to be 0-13% in studies on laser surgery for supraglottic carcinomas [6]. Perioperative morbidity is higher after open supraglottic partial resection than after transoral laser surgery and the functional results in terms of swallowing and the need for permanent tracheotomy or secondary laryngectomy in case of aspiration are worse [347]. For example, Prades et al. reported pulmonary complications in 6% of patients after supraglottic partial resection © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.8. Functionality and quality of life 95 [348]. Sevilla et al. [349] reported the need for permanent tracheostomy in 15% of patients and functional laryngectomy due to aspiration in 9% of patients. In contrast, the voice is usually unaffected postoperatively after partial resection according to Alonso [162]. After partial supracricoid resection, however, a deterioration in voice quality of varying degrees is reported - corresponding to the tumor-related resection of both vocal cords plus/minus an arytenoid cartilage, plus/minus epiglottis with preepiglottic fatty tissue [350]: Depending on the extent of the resection with or without the epiglottis, the postoperative Phonation mechanism from an arytenoid cartilage against the epiglottis or against the base of the tongue. The voice is accordingly rough, and after resection of an arytenoid cartilage it is often breathy. As a rule, there is an improvement in the quality of the voice after speech therapy when the patient has learned the new phonation mechanism with closure in a more anterior-posterior direction: The voice remains rough, but becomes stronger and more capable. The literature also gives different figures regarding the incidence of postoperative swallowing disorders. Benito et al. reported aspiration rates of approximately 30% after supracricoid partial resection, with 10% having a severe tendency to aspiration [351]. Other studies reported a persistent tendency to aspiration in 0.5-39% of patients after supracricoid partial resection. While some studies describe better functional results after CHEP compared to CHP, other studies show no difference between these treatment methods [6]. Swallowing disorders appear to be associated in particular with the extent of resection in the area of the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages. Some studies show that there is a higher risk of aspiration after arytenoid resection as part of supracricoid partial resection, other studies cannot confirm this connection. The risk of aspiration is significantly increased in patients older than 65 years, although with good patient selection (good lung function, sufficient cognition and motivation for speech therapy) an older patient age is not a contraindication for open partial resections [6]. In particular, the partial resection according to Sedlacek-Kambic- Tucker with preservation of both arytenoid cartilages is, according to reports from many authors, also expressly considered for older patients or patients with slightly impaired lung function [286]. In a systematic review of swallowing disorders after supracricoid partial resection, Lips et al [163] concluded that postoperative dysphagia improves significantly within 3 months after surgery and that there is only a low rate of severe complications after a long follow-up period. Overall, tracheostomy closure can be performed in 90-99% of patients after supracricoid partial resection. Quality of life Studies on the quality of life in patients with T1 and T2 vocal cord carcinomas were not systematically researched for this guideline. In case-control studies, no significant difference between the quality of life after laser therapy versus radiotherapy could be shown.

Supportive therapy 96 Radiotherapy showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities [339]. 7.9. Supportive therapy In the case of laryngeal carcinoma, the various treatment options interact with each other and with many different normal tissues. Potential side effects (organ loss due to surgery, fibrosis after radiotherapy) influence the treatment - in the primary decision, the combinability and the prognosis. Prevention, treatment and support in the management of treatment consequences have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with and after laryngeal carcinoma. For this reason, side effects are also discussed in various parts of the other chapters of this guideline. This chapter deals with the prophylaxis and treatment of individual side effects of treatment for laryngeal carcinoma, and general supportive measures, which are to be understood in the broader sense as supportive therapy. In principle, a distinction must be made between side effects that occur during and immediately after therapy and those that either occur immediately and are long-lasting or occur over a longer period after therapy - the latter are particularly observed after radiotherapy. At this point, reference is made to the S3 guideline on supportive measures in oncology, the first version of which was published in October 2016. Many specific side effects are described in detail there and presented with recommendations. In order to avoid overlapping updates, the following side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will not be commented on here, even if they are relevant: • Anemia / Neutropenia • Nausea/Emesis • Diarrhea • Oral mucositis due to chemotherapy • Tumor therapy-induced skin toxicity • Chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity (CIPN) • Supportive therapy in radiation oncology O O O O O Radiodermatitis Radiation osteonecrosis Radiogenic mucositis Radiogenic xerostomia Effects of radiation on the brain and spinal cord The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer is shocking for most patients and can change their life plans in one fell swoop. After the shock of the cancer diagnosis and the explanation of the expected therapy including further post-operative treatments, the patient must process the explanation of the possible changes in voice formation, breathing, facio-oral functions (smell, blowing) and stigmatizing changes in the throat area (stoma). It is therefore important to offer the patient rehabilitation and © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 97 To demonstrate support options through social services, nursing staff, speech therapy, physiotherapy, physical therapy and psychosocial services (see chapter7.10 ) [352]. All these measures are to be seen as an essential component of supportive therapy, which is not limited to drug treatment of normal tissue reactions that have occurred. 7.9.1. Prevention, side effects and treatment of chemo – and radiotherapy 7.9.1.1. Specific supportive measures after laryngectomy 7.61. Consensus-based recommendation EEC After laryngectomy, humidification of the lower respiratory tract should be ensured. Strong consensus: 100% 7.62. Consensus-based recommendation EEC After laryngectomy, the patient should be instructed in the independent care and handling of the cannula and should be given as much long-term support as necessary. Strong consensus: 100% Humidification Due to the removal of the larynx, the patient breathes through the stoma in the throat. The respiratory and digestive tracts are separated. The patient can no longer speak with his or her original voice. In addition, nasal breathing and therefore the physiological moistening, warming and filtering of the inhaled air, as well as blowing the nose and vocal laughter, are permanently eliminated. Regular inhalation to moisten the lower respiratory tract becomes necessary. Moisture filters that are placed on the tracheostomy and function like an \"artificial nose\" have proven to be helpful [353, 354]. Nursing care for the tracheostomy Immediately after the operation, the patient and, where possible, their relatives are given instructions on tracheostomy care. There is information material and training instructions for this that have been developed by a multi-professional team, such as the BVMed brochure [355]. The training covers suction, changing the cannula, tracheostomy care, cleaning and caring for the cannula, and general aspects of personal hygiene and the necessary changes in dealing with everyday situations. It is important to convey security and self-confidence in handling the procedure. Further information is available from the self-help group for those who have had laryngeal surgery and can be found in the patient version of the guideline. An early removal of the tracheostomy tube can lead to a significant constriction and thus to shortness of breath. Wearing a tracheostomy tube after laryngectomy can only be dispensed with if there is no longer any spontaneous shrinkage of the tracheostomy. This is for patients, © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 98 who are learning the ructus voice, is of great advantage. However, care must be taken during the laryngectomy to ensure that the tracheostomy is wide and completely epithelialized (see above). It is advisable to create the tracheostomy in a separate, wide skin incision above the jugulum. The tracheostomy without a cannula should be protected with a special cloth. Tracheostomy tubes After a tracheotomy, cannulas keep the newly created tracheostomy open [356]. A rough distinction can be made between blockable and non-blockable tracheostomy tubes. Blockable tracheostomy tubes consist of the actual tube and the cuff. In the event of aspiration, e.g. of saliva, the cuff prevents the aspirate from flowing unhindered into the bronchi and lungs. Blockable cannulas are used when the larynx is still present and complete closure of the trachea is necessary. This is the case, for example, during ventilation or postoperatively in the intensive care unit when the patient cannot swallow his saliva and there is a risk that saliva and food will be aspirated into the lower respiratory tract. Blocked cannulas often have to be kept in for a long time in patients after partial resections. They prevent vocal speech and limit the sense of smell and taste. Non-blockable cannulas are usually double-barreled. The cannula contains an inner tube, the so-called core, which can be removed for cleaning without having to remove the entire cannula. These cannulas are now mostly made of thermoplastics. Speaking cannulas also have a window along their length so that air can be directed through into the larynx when exhaling. Speaking valves, valves with a flap, are placed on the cannula. These open when inhaling and allow the tracheostomy tube to be used when inhaling (“short path”) and breathing through the larynx when exhaling (“long path”) and producing a voice. After laryngectomy, non-blockable cannulas are used. Regular use of HME filters (heat and moisture exchangers - artificial noses), humidifiers and inhalations is necessary. One of the most common problems is drying out of the trachea with crusting, since the moistening function of the nose is no longer available [356]. cleaning To avoid complications, the tracheostomy tube must be cleaned daily and the (surgically created) tracheostomy must be inspected. Tracheostomy tubes in intensive care units must be changed under sterile conditions in accordance with the rules in force there; the tubes are exchanged and replaced with new ones. The same procedure is followed for patients with bacterial colonization in the tracheal secretion, e.g. MRSA. In everyday use, the same hygiene rules apply to a tracheostomy tube as to a denture. Tracheostomy tubes made of plastic (or silver) are cleaned under running water with a bottle brush. Special disinfection is not absolutely necessary on a daily basis. Suction When suctioning, care must be taken to ensure that no additional injuries are caused to the tracheal mucous membranes. For a gentle © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 99 When suctioning the trachea, a so-called finger tip should be placed between the suction tube and the suction catheter so that it is possible to remove the suction when inserting the catheter and to apply suction to the suction catheter when removing it by closing the finger tip. The suction catheter should not be inserted too deeply, otherwise it will hit the carina and cause injury there. If suctioning results in blood, the cannula may not be seated correctly and must be readjusted. Problems/Complications Tracheostomy tubes can be used for a long time if they are cleaned and disinfected properly. A tracheostomy tube must be replaced outside the intervals specified by the manufacturer if the tube can no longer be completely cleaned or no longer fulfils its function. Plastic tubes age and can harden over time. The plastic becomes porous and/or the thermoplastics lose their elasticity. The time until such symptoms appear varies. If the patient needs air and turns blue, e.g. due to a clogged tube, the patient or the first person to arrive must take the first step, removing or changing the tracheostomy tube. Every person (doctor, nurse, therapist and family member) who is entrusted with the care of patients with a tracheostomy tube must be able to change a tracheostomy tube. Clinical experience shows that complications can arise time and again due to the tracheostomy tube. Inflammations The most common complication in the area of the tracheostomy is inflammation, when saliva leaks out of the tracheostomy and attacks the surrounding skin or the stoma canal. Moist compresses must therefore be changed regularly. The skin surface around the reddened tracheostomy can be cared for with zinc ointment, which is applied generously. In addition, the tracheostomy tube can be wrapped with a narrow tamponade to care for the tracheostomy canal. Zinc ointment can also be applied to this strip of ointment. In severe cases, antibiotics are required. The skin around the tracheostomy can only be expected to heal completely when swallowing is aspiration-free. Granulations on the tracheostomy are caused by mechanical irritations at the edge of the tracheostomy caused by hard, inflexible cannulas or a cannula band that is too tight. Measures include changing the position of the tracheostomy tube, changing the type of tracheostomy tube, removing it by etching with silver nitrate, or ablation using a laser or an electric knife under local anesthesia. In order to prevent complications of the trachea, such as damage to the mucous membrane or developing tracheal stenosis due to compressed tracheal cartilage, the trachea must be checked endoscopically at regular intervals. Tracheal stenosis does not necessarily occur immediately after removal of a tracheostomy tube or closure of the tracheostomy. Inflamed tracheal braces often lead to clinically relevant stenosis only after 3-4 months. Patients who complain of increasing shortness of breath should be examined immediately for clinically relevant tracheal stenosis [356]. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 100 7.9.1.2. Resuscitation in patients with tracheostomy 7.63. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Departments and practices treating patients after laryngectomy and emergency physicians should have the material for the specific ventilation situation on hand and be trained in its use. Strong consensus: 100% In emergency situations, ventilation can only be provided in the form of mouth-to-neck breathing as part of first aid. Every patient who has had a tracheostomy should carry an appropriate emergency ID card. Appropriate aids such as ventilation funnels are available in all emergency medical facilities (ambulances, emergency rooms, emergency rooms) and in all medical facilities where tracheotomized patients are cared for (speech therapy and physiotherapy practices, doctor's offices). 7.9.1.3. Side effects and their treatment after radio(chemo)therapy During radio(chemo)therapy, the acute side effects listed above are the most common (skin reaction, mucositis, xerostomia, radiation effects on nerve tissue). In addition, there is loss of taste, nausea/vomiting, fatigue and weakness. Severe side effects often lead to the patient wanting to stop or pause the therapy, both of which significantly compromise the effectiveness of the therapy. Optimal prophylaxis and therapy are essential components of successful tumor therapy. There are also chronic side effects that potentially occur in the long term, but the probability of which can be reduced - at least in part - by adequate prophylaxis. This particularly affects changes to the teeth and jaw, but also chronic xerostomia and trismus. There are also other chronic side effects of combined therapy such as lymphedema, functional limitations of the neck and throat muscles, and chronically delayed wound healing with a tendency to scarring and fistula formation. A variety of different changes can trigger chronic swallowing disorders, aspiration, or hoarseness - examples include progressive fibrosis of the pharyngeal muscles; chronic mucous membrane edema in the area of the laryngeal entrance, the aripiglottic fold, and the vestibular folds; late edema in the entire larynx [216]; neuropathies and scarring of the mucosa; cartilage necrosis in the laryngeal region. All of these side effects require close patient care, ideally by an interdisciplinary team. The sequence of measures is also important - dental treatment must be carried out before radiotherapy begins, but the time window from surgery to adjuvant therapy should not be longer than 6 weeks without a compelling reason. If the patient is seen by a dentist preoperatively, tooth extractions can be performed during anesthesia for tumor resection if necessary. It also helps with adherence if patients receive the same care instructions from all co-treating physicians and other professional groups. The benefits of incorporating nutritional therapy and voice rehabilitation at an early stage have been described elsewhere. Coordinated management is therefore required. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 101 Once chronic changes have occurred, they usually remain, their frequency increases over the long term, and there is little literature on incidence and therapy. Overall, it is recommended that patients with newly occurring symptoms after oncological therapy, including radiotherapy, be presented to a radiotherapist in order to establish a possible connection and to explain treatment options. 7.9.1.4. Supportive therapy for laryngeal carcinoma from the perspective of dentist/oral surgeon surgery 7.64. Consensus-based recommendation EEC If radiochemotherapy is planned for laryngeal carcinoma (primary or adjuvant), a dental check-up should be carried out before starting treatment. The patient should be informed about prophylactic measures. Strong consensus: 100% In the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma, the maintenance and rehabilitation of a functional stomatognathic system (teeth, oral cavity, jaw) plays an important role in maintaining quality of life. When preparing a laryngeal carcinoma patient for surgical or radiotherapy, germs in the oral cavity should be reduced by professional dental removal of soft and hard dental plaque. In the case of planned radiotherapy of the larynx region, a relatively low radiation exposure to the lower jaw and teeth is to be expected (depending on the extent of the tumor and the affected lymphatic drainage pathways). This results in these patients being classified in the “low-risk group” according to Studer et al. [357]. Nevertheless, the recommended prophylactic measures for the stomatognathic system should be observed [358-362]. • Teeth that cannot be saved due to deep carious lesions, apical lesions, fistulas, severe periodontal degradation with less than 50% anchoring of the root in the tooth socket and partially impacted teeth should be removed. No statement can be made about the preservation of root-filled teeth with no periodontal abnormalities. Sharp bone edges can be surgically reduced before radiotherapy. • To avoid infected osteoradionecrosis (IORN), these measures should be taken three weeks before the start of radiation therapy so that the bone wound can heal epithelially by then. • Carious teeth that can be preserved should be treated with fillings (e.g. glass ionomer cements or composites) before radiotherapy begins [363]. If teeth that can be preserved are present, two soft (silicone) splints with different functions should be used during radiotherapy: • If metal dental restorations (e.g. crowns) are present, mucous membrane retractors of approximately 4 mm thickness should be used as spacers to the oral mucosa directly during radiation application. These keep soft tissue out of the backscatter area of the electrons and thus lead to a dose reduction of over 90% of the secondary radiation. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 102 • If teeth and dental restorations (e.g. crowns) are present, fluoridation trays of approximately 2 mm thickness should be used to apply non-acidic fluoridation gels before and during radiotherapy. During the radiation period, these fluoridation trays aredaily In the evening, after cleaning your teeth, before going to bed, fill the mouth with about 1 cm of fluoride gel. The splint is then inserted and left in place for about 5 minutes. The splint is then removed, the mouth is rinsed with a little water and nothing more should be eaten or drunk. • After the radiation period, this fluoridation should be used to prevent radiation cariesthree times a week be continued throughout life. • During radiation therapy and in the presence of radiation-induced mucositis, removable dentures should not be worn (“denture abstinence”). Some authors recommend a continued denture abstinence for 3-6 months despite intact mucosa, particularly in the lower jaw, for mucosa-supported dentures [364]. • Dentures can be worn to the extent necessary to prevent tooth migration, which would render the dentures unusable. • In case of dry mouth, a pH-neutral saliva substitute should be used. Acidic polysaccharide-containing saliva substitutes are no longer recommended for dentate patients due to the proven loss of hard dental tissue [365, 366]. • In the follow-up care of irradiated head and neck cancer patients, attention is paid to early symptoms of developing infected osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, such as: O O O O O O Tooth loosening Fetor ex ore Loss of sensitivity of the lower lip (Vincent symptom) Swelling (edema, soft tissue induration, fluctuation) Fistula, exudation Prosthetic pressure point • Interventions involving injury to the gums, such as extractions, should only be performed under special precautions such as perioperative oral antibiotics, atraumatic surgical technique and primary plastic closure of the surgical wound. 7.9.2. Side effects and their treatment after chemotherapy Chemotherapy is very often administered simultaneously with radiation (primary or adjuvant) and in palliative therapy situations also alone. The most common potential side effects of the substances used (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, altered blood formation, mucositis, PNP) are discussed in detail in the above-mentioned S3-LL Supportive Measures in Oncology. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 103 7.9.3. Side effects and their treatment in targeted therapy The increasing number of patients treated with targeted therapies that induce specific cutaneous side effects requires good management and interdisciplinary collaboration between dermatologists and oncologists from other disciplines so that therapy can be maintained as planned. [367] Cutaneous side effects are seen in up to 34% of patients with multikinase inhibitors, in up to 90% with selective kinase inhibitors such as EGFR inhibitors and inhibitors of mutated BRAF, and in up to 68% with immunotherapeutic agents such as CTLA-4 blockers. These side effects can correlate with the response to therapy, but they can also limit drug tumor therapy due to their localization in visible areas of the body or due to their severity [368]. The frequency of cutaneous side effects during targeted therapy requires correct and early diagnosis and optimal side effect management, since deficits in this area can jeopardize patient adherence to therapy and thus the success of therapy [369]. Although certain measures cannot prevent the development of side effects on the skin, they can influence their severity and prevent possible complications. The following advice for patients is generally accepted: • Use only water and soap-free lotions to clean the skin • Do not wash your skin unnecessarily (no long showers or baths), only use lukewarm water • The use of nourishing lotions or creams should be discussed with the doctor, even if they are not prescription-only. Not every preparation is helpful in every phase of skin changes. Ointments containing fat are often harmful. • Avoid high room temperatures, increase humidity if skin is dry • Adequate light protection, avoidance of direct sunlight • Wear light, breathable and non-constricting clothing / Wear loose shoes to avoid pressure on the nail bed / Wear cotton-lined gloves when doing housework • Gentle, careful nail care, do not push back cuticles 7.9.4. Side effects and their treatment during surgery In contrast to complications, side effects are typical symptoms after surgery that are always to be expected, even if they occur in varying degrees. Surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinoma always leads to functional impairments of varying degrees. The least functional disturbances occur after transoral laser surgical resection of T1 carcinomas of the vocal cords. The dysphonia that occurs after this usually disappears significantly after a few weeks, supported by speech therapy. After laser surgical resection of T2 carcinomas, in which a © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.9. Supportive therapy 104 However, if a chordectomy is necessary, the larger tissue defect causes permanent dysphonia, since complete glottic closure is no longer possible postoperatively. Since the larynx separates the airway from the food path, one of the common side effects after extensive partial resections is aspiration, as the protective mechanisms of the laryngeal entrance no longer function. This problem does not occur when the larynx is completely removed, as in this situation the airway is separated from the food path. If a voice prosthesis is used, there is a risk of a pharyngo-tracheal fistula forming. After the placement of voice prostheses, dilation of the tracheoesophageal fistulas occurs in both early and late stages. More extensive transoral resections, particularly involving the arytenoid region, can therefore lead to dysphagia with chronic aspiration in addition to dysphonia. This is particularly pronounced in transoral horizontal partial resections due to the absence of the epiglottis protecting the laryngeal entrance. These functional disorders also occur in partial resections that are performed externally. In classic horizontal partial resections, there is a risk of aspiration if the dysphonia is mild, whereas in vertical partial resections the risk of aspiration is low but the dysphonia is very severe. In cases of chronic aspiration after partial resection that does not improve despite intensive training and rehabilitation measures, laryngectomy can be considered in selected cases. In some extensive procedures, shortness of breath can be a typical side effect, requiring a temporary or even permanent tracheotomy. After a laryngectomy, there is a loss of smell due to the lack of nasal breathing and the risk of recurrent inflammation of the trachea due to the loss of the nose as a filter and humidifier. This can lead to the development of tracheitis, which requires intensive inpatient treatment. After a laryngectomy, abdominal pressure, for example when lifting heavy loads, is also not possible. One of the serious side effects is the loss of voice after a laryngectomy, which naturally cannot be avoided due to the removal of the vocal organ. However, various rehabilitation measures are available to develop a replacement voice. A less common functional disorder after laryngectomy is stenosis of the hypopharynx, which occurs particularly after adjuvant radiotherapy and can then lead to significant dysphagia, even aphagia. (see chapter7.10.4 ). Many of these typical side effects can be eliminated or reduced through intensive swallowing or voice training. In many cases, drug or surgical treatment of side effects is not possible. After a neck dissection, swelling in the head and neck area can occur due to congestion and drainage problems in the lymph vessels. Head movements, such as turning and tilting, can also be restricted. This can occur mainly after adjuvant radiotherapy and the onset of radiation fibrosis, but also after lesions of the accessory nerve. Physical and physiotherapeutic treatments can lead to improvement, although there are no studies that prove the effect of lymphatic drainage. Damage to other nerves (hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve, vagus nerve, sympathetic trunk and phrenic nerve) can also occur. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10.

Consensus-based recommendation EEC For the best possible functional result, peri- and post-therapeutic rehabilitative measures should be part of the therapy concept. Consensus: 91% 7.66. Consensus-based recommendation EEC As part of primary therapy, information should be provided about the possibility of contacting self-help groups. Strong consensus: 100% The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer is shocking for most patients and can change their life plans in one fell swoop. It is therefore important to show the patient rehabilitation and support options through social services, nursing staff, speech therapy, physiotherapy, physical therapy and psychosocial services and self-help groups [352]. S3 guidelines exist for supportive therapy and psycho-oncological care, which are also valid for the treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer (http:// leitlinienprogrammonkologie.de ). After the shock of the cancer diagnosis and the expected therapy, including further postoperative treatments, the patient must process the information about the possible changes in voice production, breathing and swallowing and other facio-oral functions and stigmatizing changes in the neck area (stoma). Depending on the surgical procedure, laryngectomy or partial removal of the larynx, different problems arise that can be addressed with different rehabilitative measures. Chronic side effects after radiotherapy may influence treatment options, long-term outcome and functional recovery. 7.10.1. Swallowing training In the preoperative consultation, the speech therapist informs the patient about the various rehabilitation measures in advance in consultation with the treating doctor, who explains the planned procedure and the resulting possibilities for voice rehabilitation. The speech therapist is available to answer the patient's questions about swallowing rehabilitation. In everyday clinical practice, FEES (fiber optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing) plays a central role in diagnosis and therapy control. Speech therapy in the inpatient area begins as early as possible after surgery. In consultation with the doctors, if there are no complications, the © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 106 The elasticity of the muscles of the neck, face and speech organs should be promoted [370]. To optimize the therapeutic results, early, adequate pain and nutritional therapy should be initiated if necessary [371]. If no subsequent inpatient treatment takes place, outpatient swallowing therapy should be carried out promptly. 7.10.1.1. Swallowing training after laryngectomy 7.67. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Swallowing function should be examined as early as possible postoperatively. The aim is to enable rapid oral intake of food and, if necessary, swallowing training, depending on the healing process and the therapy methods used. Consensus: 86% In the oral cavity, sensory disturbances or (usually unilateral) paralysis of the tongue can occur after damage to the hypoglossal nerve caused by neck dissection. Promoting elasticity of the neck muscles, swallowing aids and dietary adjustment of consistencies can be helpful [371, 372]. Swallowing disorders in the sense of passage disorders with retention (food residues) in the throat usually only occur after a few weeks or after radiation due to stenosis, which must be clarified by a doctor. The most common causes are swelling of the mucous membrane, scarring or recurrences. Due to the separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts, the restoration of nutrition after laryngectomy is usually uncomplicated, provided no stenosis has developed. Aspirations are only known to occur when the shunt valve is leaking. Swallowing disorders in the sense of passage disorders with retention (food residues) in the throat usually only occur after a few weeks or after radiation due to stenosis. The most common causes are swelling of the mucous membrane, scarring or recurrences, which must be diagnosed. 7.10.1.2. Swallowing training after hemilaryngectomy 7.68. Consensus-based recommendation EEC After partial laryngectomy, the risk of aspiration should be reduced by early breathing/ swallowing training. Strong consensus: 100% Partial resections of the larynx are basically function-preserving measures, but depending on the surgical procedure (partial or classic chordectomy, frontoanterior or frontolateral partial resection, hemilaryngectomy or horizontal partial resection), they can lead to functional impairments [373, 374]. The breathing-swallowing coordination can be severely impaired after a partial resection. Unlike with a total laryngectomy, the air and digestive tracts are not separated. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 107 The consequences are swallowing difficulties, aspiration and the wearing of a blocked tracheostomy tube, which makes vocal speech impossible [356, 374]. In addition, the regular suctioning of aspirated saliva often has a significant impact on the quality of life for a long time. Swallowing rehabilitation and tracheostomy tube management therefore often take priority over voice rehabilitation. Swallowing should be trained as early as possible. Therapy includes elements of promoting elasticity to improve mobility and coordination of processes in the respiratory and swallowing tract [356] as well as compensatory procedures (such as changes in head position when swallowing, swallowing maneuvers [375]. Various studies show a reduction in dysphagia when therapy is started early [376] and poorer therapy results when therapy is started later [264]. Kulbersh et al. [265] confirm clinical observations that swallowing results after radiotherapy were significantly better when speech therapy was started 14 days before radiation. In order for the patient to withstand the stress of therapy, adequate pain and nutritional therapy is necessary at an early stage [371]. If possible, tube feeding should not be the patient's sole form of nutrition. Gillespie et al. [377] showed that swallowing ability deteriorated after 14 days of tube feeding alone without oral nutrition. During regular oral intake of even small amounts, all structures involved in the swallowing process are moved and kept elastic several times a day. If the removal of the tracheostomy tube (decannulation) is not possible during the inpatient stay due to aspiration and the inability to swallow, the therapy must be continued in an inpatient rehabilitation facility or on an outpatient basis. The staff of the outpatient care service must be experienced in handling tubes. Any necessary functional voice rehabilitation must also be carried out on an outpatient basis. 7.10.2. Voice rehabilitation 7.69. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Even before starting tumor therapy, future voice function should be considered. Patients should be informed about the various rehabilitation options with the involvement of speech therapists and patient care workers from self-help groups. Strong consensus: 100% 7.70. Consensus-based recommendation EEC When deciding which procedure to use for voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy, the expected anatomical conditions after treatment and the patient's preference should be taken into account. Consensus: 86% © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 108 The speech therapist has the task of explaining to the patient the functional changes caused by the type(s) of voice rehabilitation and aids such as the initial equipment kit and, if necessary, prosthetic treatment of the tracheostomy, and answering any questions that may arise. Topics may include communication strategies shortly after the procedure, the temporary wearing of a tracheostomy tube, short-term artificial nutrition via a gastric tube, as well as management options in the treatment of complications that may arise. The speech therapist will address the emotional situation of the patient and his relatives if necessary. It is reassuring for patients to know who will support them in their rehabilitation postoperatively and who will be available to answer any questions. If this has not already been done preoperatively, contact options for representatives of self-help groups, social services, psycho-oncology services, aid companies, etc. are also shown. Speech therapists play an important guiding role here [352, 378]. The three most common methods of voice production after laryngectomy are speaking with an electronic speech aid, esophageal voice substitute and speaking via a voice valve [352, 372, 379]. In about 20% of cases, no suitable substitute voice can be learned, so that patients can only communicate by means of gestures and pseudo-whispering [380]. Pseudo-whispering Immediately after the operation, pseudo-whispering (= whispering with accentuated articulation), which is relatively easy to learn, writing boards and facial expressions/gestures are used for communication. Good self-awareness is necessary for voice rehabilitation. Therefore, hearing aids must be considered early on if there is any hearing impairment. Voice valve - tracheo-esophageal fistula Peri- or postoperatively, a connection is created between the trachea and the esophagus, into which the one-way valve with a plastic (silicone) flap is inserted. The exhaled air causes the mucous membrane of the upper esophageal sphincter to vibrate via this voice valve. This creates the sound. When voicing, the neck opening must either be closed with a finger or closed with a well-fitted tracheostomy filter (“freehand”). Postoperatively, the patient is still provided with a tracheostomy tube until the neck opening has healed and is stable. The patient must be instructed and instructed in the handling and cleaning of the voice valve [352]. If the valve is blocked by contamination, voice production is not possible. If it is leaking, liquid or food particles can enter the windpipe (aspiration). The valve must then be replaced. A rarer complication is the loss of the valve due to swallowing in the stomach or aspiration into the airways. In the latter case, the valve must be removed from the lower respiratory tract. Complications have been described in approximately 30% of patients, but these can usually be easily and safely resolved through regular oncological follow-up care [381]. Neoglottis – body’s own shunt When speaking with a “neoglottis”, a surgically created shunt, the exhaled air produces sounds in the area of the vibrating © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 109 Esophageal sphincter. Complications such as the opening closing up require another surgical procedure. Esophageal substitute voice (ructus, burping voice) Air belched up from the esophagus causes the mucous membrane on the upper esophageal sphincter to vibrate to produce sound. Learning this requires patience and a long therapy process. Nevertheless, it is useful for patients to at least learn the basics of this method so that they can communicate in everyday life using short statements, especially as a stopgap when a shunt valve no longer functions. The advantage is that no aids such as a voice valve or electronic speech aid are necessary. Electronic speech aid Speaking with an electronic speech aid is easy to learn and can be a help, especially in the beginning, and a supplement later on, e.g. when making phone calls if the esophageal substitute voice is not learned or the voice valve is not working. Good articulation movements and a free hand to operate the device are required. Problems can arise due to a technical defect, an empty battery or a lack of movement coordination on the part of the patient. Coupling problems can also arise due to long-term tissue changes (especially radiogenic fibrosis if adjuvant radiotherapy is used, or pronounced lymphedema after surgery +/- RT). Summary of replacement voice types When comparing the types of voice replacement, it has been shown that speaking with voice valves is generally best understood [380]. However, in order to be flexible when needed, the use of all three options (voice valve, ructus and electronic speech aid) is the best option. The use of a voice prosthesis must be discussed in detail with the patient, and the possibility of shunt insufficiency with subsequent aspiration must be mentioned. When learning the esophageal voice replacement, it is generally possible to remove a voice prosthesis, but there is a relatively high risk, especially after adjuvant radiation, that the opening will no longer close spontaneously. Representatives of self-help groups are happy to demonstrate the various voice rehabilitation methods to the patient pre- or postoperatively. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10.

Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 111 7.10.3. Psychosocial rehabilitation 7.10.3.1. Vocational rehabilitation 7.71. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Vocational rehabilitation after laryngeal cancer is a particular challenge due to the functional limitations and should be taken into account in the decision-making process from the start of therapy. Strong consensus: 100% For patients of working age ≤ 60 years after laryngectomy, it is very important or extremely important to be able to return to work after diagnosis and oncological treatment [382]. A systematic literature review on vocational rehabilitation after laryngectomy [382] revealed that return to work rates after surgery vary greatly depending on the country in which the patient lives and when the study was conducted: Spain, 1990s, 11% [383], USA, 1970s, 26% [384], Soviet Union, 1980s, 27% [385], France, 1980s, 50% [386], Soviet Union, 1960s, 51% [387] and Norway, 1970s, 63% [388] of all patients. Considering only those who were employed before surgery, reintegration rates were 20% in Germany in the 1980s [389], 32% in Germany in the 1960s [390], and 41.5% in the USA during the 1970s [384]. There are only a few corresponding data for Germany. In the Central German LE study [382], 38% of patients ≤ 60 years of age were employed before laryngectomy, one year after laryngectomy only 13%, two years after LE 15% and three years after LE 14%. Most patients (65%) received a disability pension. Of all patients who were employed before LE, 27% still had a job after LE. In a register-based study in the Free State of Thuringia, three-quarters of the head and neck cancer patients surveyed (at least 2 years after diagnosis, ≤ 60 years old) stated that they had been employed before the diagnosis, while at the time of the survey this figure had fallen to only one-third. Successful vocational reintegration is not only associated with a better social and financial status of those affected, but also with better psychological well-being [391, 392]. For this reason, an important goal of social and social law advisory services is to secure material and economic existence as well as participation in working life and to enable access to social welfare benefits. The psychosocial counselling services of the social services should be low-threshold, i.e. that patients with laryngeal carcinoma in the inpatient context receive an initial oncological consultation from the social workers of the acute hospitals and This will ensure that those affected and their families receive basic psychosocial information, such as information on social law, advice on medical and professional © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 112 Rehabilitation options, assistance with applications, psychosocial counseling in conflict situations or for dealing with illness and, if necessary, initial interventions are possible. Outpatient cancer counseling centers also offer low-threshold psychosocial counseling on psychological, social and social-legal issues for the phase after inpatient treatment and provide information about self-help groups and other counseling services. 7.10.3.2. Psycho-oncological care 7.72. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Immediate and long-term needs-based psycho-oncological care should be ensured. Strong consensus: 100% Approximately 30% of all patients with head and neck cancer suffer from severe psychological stress [394-399], and their relatives also frequently suffer from anxiety and depression [398]. Often, these psychological stresses are not actively reported by the patients, so that they go unnoticed by the treating physician and therefore remain untreated [400, 401]. Head and neck cancer patients experience a deterioration in their psychological well-being over time more frequently than other cancer patients [402], which is probably due to the fact that they are less likely to ask for social support and therefore receive less support. It is therefore particularly important that the doctor and the treatment team actively and repeatedly inquire about the patient's psychological stress [403]. This can be done in personal discussions and/or with the help of computer-based routine screening during follow-up care [404]. Psycho-oncological care has been proven to help improve the psychological well-being of cancer patients and increase their quality of life [405]. All patients with increased psychological stress should therefore be offered such care, for example with a direct referral to a psycho- oncologist. Psycho-oncological care should not only be offered during the patient's inpatient treatment, but should also be considered in the follow-up care. It should be based on the S3 guideline \"Psycho-oncological diagnostics, counseling and therapy\" [393]. The treatment phase as well as the disease- and therapy-related effects on physical, psychological and social functioning often lead to dramatic changes in the social life of people with cancer and their caregivers. The burdens include: • family and social stress (e.g. conflicts in relationships, conflicts in dealing with the illness and its consequences, the need for care of the affected person or uncared-for relatives, loss of social contacts in the circle of friends or clubs) © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 113 • professional changes (problems at work, limited and inadequate professional performance up to loss of earning capacity and job, difficulties in finding a new job) • Financial burdens (e.g. due to reduced income, co-payments for health services, travel costs) 7.10.3.3. Social legal support 7.73. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Patients and relatives should be informed about possible psychosocial consequences and possible help as part of the primary therapy. Consensus: 92% The treatment phase as well as the disease- and therapy-related effects on physical, psychological and social functioning often lead to dramatic changes in the social life of people with cancer and their caregivers. These non-medical aspects and burdens should also be taken into account during the initial information process about the tumor disease, the treatment options and the time course, as described above. This includes in particular the doctor's reference to additional contacts in the various areas and the wide range of possible assistance. 7.10.3.4. Medical rehabilitation 7.74. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Patients with laryngeal carcinoma should be informed that they are entitled to follow-up treatment (AHB) under social law. Rehabilitation should be recommended by a doctor. In addition, medical treatment and outpatient rehabilitation measures may be recommended. Consensus: 95% 7.75.

Consensus: 95% © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.10. Rehabilitation, psychosocial care and supportive therapy 114 7.76. Consensus-based recommendation EEC For the best possible functional result, peri- and post-therapeutic rehabilitative measures should be part of the therapy concept. Consensus: 91% Depending on the patient's need for rehabilitation and their ability and willingness to undergo rehabilitation, an inpatient rehabilitation measure in the form of follow-up treatment (AHB) should be carried out after the primary therapy. The consequences of a mostly multimodal therapy consisting of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and other drug therapy methods must be treated. The aim of medical rehabilitation is to promote the self-determined participation of patients in the sense of an independent and self-responsible social life despite health and functional limitations and to enable reintegration into working life. The follow-up treatment is prescribed by the treating doctors as part of the inpatient stay or as part of the outpatient tumor follow-up care. The social services of the acute hospitals provide advice and initiate the rehabilitation. Laryngeal carcinoma patients who have received radiotherapy should not begin rehabilitation until six weeks after the end of the radiation treatment. Although the acute skin changes diminish shortly after the radiation treatment, lymphedema develops increasingly in the skin and mucous membranes of the head and neck area, which is fully developed after six weeks and must be treated with lymphatic drainage. For this reason, the period for starting rehabilitation after radiotherapy has been extended to up to 10 weeks. In individual cases, rehabilitation can begin earlier as a complex medical inpatient measure with swallowing examination and training, nutritional stabilization, lymphatic drainage, exercise therapy and adapted medication and pain therapy. Depending on the extent of the symptoms and functional impairments, the patient has the opportunity to repeat the inpatient rehabilitation measure. 7.10.4. Nutrition The diet must be adapted to the treatment procedure and the resulting function of the swallowing act. In addition, it must be taken into account that sensory disturbances in the oral cavity following damage to the hypoglossal nerve or mucositis following radiation can impair food intake. Compensatory swallowing techniques and dietary adjustment of consistencies can be helpful [371, 372]. 7.10.4.1. Nutritional aspects after partial laryngectomy Aspiration of saliva, liquids and food are typical consequences in the first few weeks. It takes time for compensatory replacement strategies to develop to create new closures. For example, after a horizontal partial resection, unilateral hyperplasia of the base of the tongue and the contralateral arytenoid cartilage can form after a few weeks, forming the new closure. During this time, © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.11. Palliative therapy 115 an artificial form of nutrition, nasogastric tube or PEG is indicated. If everything goes well, oral training can then be started, possibly with drop by drop water and small amounts of mashed potatoes. 7.10.4.2. PEG 7.77. Consensus-based recommendation EEC A PEG should only be inserted if it is expected that tube feeding will be necessary for a longer period of time. Strong consensus: 100% After extensive partial laryngectomies and after total laryngectomies, the insertion of a nasogastric tube is necessary in the postoperative healing phase. Primary treatment with a PEG is generally not recommended in these cases, as is the case with salvage surgery. If dysphagia and especially aspiration continue to occur after the healing phase and intensive swallowing training, the nasogastric tube should be replaced with a PEG. The nasogastric tube is always moved during swallowing and can secondarily impair the motility of the pharyngeal structures and swallowing training. In addition to the foreign body sensation and avoidance of swallowing, the velopharyngeal closure and the closure of the upper esophageal sphincter are no longer physiologically present. This can change the intrapharyngeal pressure during swallowing and nasal penetration and regurgitation of gastric juice become possible. A PEG reduces these secondary symptoms and improves the conditions for further swallowing training. The patient's pre-therapeutic nutritional status, general condition and adherence must also be taken into account when choosing artificial nutrition. This particularly includes the placement of a PEG in cases of poor nutritional status and general condition before starting radio(chemo)therapy. 7.11. Palliative therapy Palliative care is defined as an approach to improving the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with a life-threatening illness [406] by preventing and alleviating suffering through early detection, careful assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Regarding palliative medicine aspects, regardless of the underlying diagnosis, reference is made to the S3 guideline on palliative medicine of the oncology guideline program [407]. Palliative (tumor) therapies are medicinal and non-medicinal measures directed against the underlying disease in patients with an incurable disease with the primary goal of prolonging life and/or controlling symptoms (e.g. radiotherapy, surgical procedures, medicinal tumor therapies) and/or improving quality of life. They relate to tumor biology and are therefore tumor-specific. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","7.11. Palliative therapy 116 Palliative medicine/palliative care aims to improve or maintain the quality of life of patients with a life-threatening illness and their families. This is done by preventing and alleviating suffering, by early recognition and treatment of physical, psychological, social and spiritual problems [408]. Palliative medicine/palliative care affirms life and sees dying as a natural process; it neither accelerates it nor delays death [409]. Palliative medicine and palliative care are used as a general term for all activities aimed at improving the quality of life of people with incurable, life-threatening (cancer) diseases and emphasize the interdisciplinary and multi-professional nature of this area of care. Palliative medicine is therefore not reduced to the medical and/or physician contribution, but is understood comprehensively in the sense of multi-professional palliative care. Patients at the end of their lives and their relatives are accompanied – at home, in palliative care day clinics and in inpatient hospices. Multiprofessional teams work together to provide care that is tailored to individual needs and choices, while striving for dignity, peace and tranquility [406, 409]. 7.11.1. Palliative systemic drug treatment 7.78.

Palliative therapy 117 7.81. Consensus-based recommendation EEC In second-line therapy, therapy with a PD-1 inhibitor should be offered. Strong consensus: 100% The development of systemic therapy is currently very dynamic, with more than 30 ongoing phase 2 and phase 3 studies. The most important effective substances are cisplatin, 5-FU, methotrexate, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cetuximab and antibodies against PD1 or PD-L1. Signal transduction inhibitors (afatinib and burlalisib) are also effective, but are not approved. There are no specific studies on laryngeal carcinoma, only collective studies for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of all head and neck locations except the nasopharynx. With monotherapy of cytotoxic substances, response rates are below 20%. Combination therapy can increase the response rate to up to 30%, but does not improve the median survival time. With the combination of platinum salts, 5-FU and cetuximab, a response rate of 36% was achieved (38% when using cisplatin). The median progression-free time was improved from 3.3 to 5.6 months by adding cetuximab to chemotherapy, and the median survival rate from 7.4 to 10.1 months [411]. However, the 2-year survival rate remained below 20%. Based on the results of this study, palliative chemotherapy with platinum (preferably cisplatin) and 5-FU in combination with cetuximab is the current standard in first-line therapy. A combination of platinum, docetaxel and cetuximab achieves similar results; results of randomized trials are pending. Monotherapy with the PD1 antibody nivolumab was investigated in a randomized study against a free comparator therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab monotherapy). Patients with platinum-refractory squamous cell carcinoma were included, mostly as second-line therapy after cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab, but also after other prior therapies, or directly after radiochemotherapy. The response rate in this mixed study was Patient population 13.3% versus 5.8% with comparator therapy, the median progression-free time 2.0 vs. 2.3 months and the median survival time 7.5 vs. 5.1 months [410]. The decisive factors for the approval of nivolumab were the increased 1-year survival rate from 16.6% to 36.0% with the indication of a plateau and the significantly improved overall survival (OS) hazard ratio (0.70, p=0.01). Similar results were achieved in two studies with the antibody pembrolizumab, which is also directed against PD1 [412, 413]. Current studies are testing additional antibodies against PD1 and PD-L1 as well as various combinations of cytotoxic substances, cetuximab, PD1/PD-L1 antibodies and numerous other immunomodulatory molecules with the aim of improving the remission rate and long-term outcomes without a significant increase in toxicity. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","8.1.

Consensus-based recommendation EEC Patients with laryngeal carcinoma should be offered regular follow-up care. Strong consensus: 100% 8.2. Consensus-based recommendation EEC The focus of follow-up care should be clinical examination including endoscopy. Consensus: 91% An essential component of the entire therapy is regular tumor follow-up, which should be carried out in an interdisciplinary manner with the co-supervising radiation oncologist and in communication with the specialist attending physician in the outpatient setting, if necessary. The importance of tumor follow-up is evident from the fact that around one fifth of patients with laryngeal carcinoma experience a local tumor recurrence, which usually occurs within the first two years; even in the third year after primary treatment, recurrences still develop in a few cases [414]. The main goal of tumor follow-up is therefore the careful examination of the larynx and neck to exclude re-growing carcinomas, which, according to the results of a retrospective study, only lead to symptoms in 61% of cases, i.e., are not noticed by 39% of patients [415]. Another benefit of tumor follow-up is the detection of metachronous secondary tumors in the upper aerodigestive tract and lung, which have a similar risk profile to laryngeal carcinoma and occur in 4-33% of patients. Furthermore, the assessment of the functional status (speech and swallowing function), the pain status and the need for rehabilitative (speech therapy, swallowing training) or supportive measures (pain therapy, nutritional therapy, physiotherapy, lymphatic drainage) is part of the tumor follow-up. In particular, in patients with incurable tumors, but also in those with functional or aesthetic impairments, it must be checked whether there is a need for psychosocial care. If primary reconstructive measures were not carried out as part of the tumor resection and there are impairments to the speech and swallowing function, the possibility of secondary reconstruction can be discussed during the follow-up consultation, provided there is no evidence of active tumor activity. The general quality of life of the patients and their psychosocial condition should also be taken into account throughout the follow-up [393].

Imaging in follow-up 119 Although the disease can have significant limitations compared to before the disease, patients often require social and psychological support [416]. The maximum follow-up intervals are 3 months for the 1st and 2nd year and 6 months for the 3rd to 5th year, even if there are no symptoms. After the 5th year, an individual decision can be made as to whether further follow-up seems necessary. In the case of a particular risk constellation or acute symptoms, more frequent examinations may be necessary in collaboration with the supervising specialist colleagues, which may extend beyond 5 years. The examinations required at each follow-up appointment include a careful and systematic inspection of the larynx, which should also include neighboring regions such as the entire oral cavity, the oropharynx and hypopharynx, in order to detect any metachronous secondary carcinomas in good time [127]. In addition, an examination of the neck by palpation and ultrasound is necessary. Easy-to-collect and useful clues to the possible presence of tumor recurrence can also be determined by asking about pain and weight loss. 8.2. Imaging in follow-up care 8.3. Consensus-based recommendation EEC If local recurrence is suspected or detected or if symptoms suggestive of metastases are present, cross-sectional imaging should be performed. Strong consensus: 100% 8.4. Consensus-based recommendation EEC In patients who have undergone surgery, cross-sectional imaging should be performed if local recurrence is suspected or confirmed or if symptoms suggestive of metastases are present. In patients undergoing primary radiation/chemotherapy, cross-sectional imaging to exclude residual tumor or residual metastasis is recommended 8-12 weeks after completion of therapy. Majority approval: 75% 8.5. Consensus-based recommendation EEC During follow-up, imaging and its examination intervals should be indicated depending on the size and location of the primary tumor and the type of therapy. Strong consensus: 100% Imaging plays an important role in the follow-up of laryngeal carcinoma and, along with endoscopy (microlaryngoscopy), is an important component of © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","8.2. Imaging in follow-up 120 Follow-up examination. This particularly applies to carcinomas that were larger than T1 with para- or supraglottic extension. In the case of small glottic carcinomas, endoscopy is superior to imaging, as smaller changes on the mucosal surface cannot be visualized. High-resolution CT is very sensitive in the area of the larynx and is the method of choice. The lymphatic drainage pathways of the neck can be visualized in the same session in order to detect or exclude metastases. MRI can be advantageous in the question of cartilage infiltration. The time interval for follow-up imaging should be determined depending on the initial tumor category. In the case of larger carcinomas (-T3), the first imaging is recommended 3 months after the end of therapy. If there is an increased risk of distant metastases, a CT of the thorax and abdomen must also be performed in the follow-up examination, possibly a PET-CT [417, 418]. After definitive radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy with a good clinical response, a contrast- enhanced baseline cross-sectional imaging of the head and neck area can be performed 8-12 weeks after the end of therapy to assess the post-therapeutic local findings. The choice of cross-sectional imaging modality (CT, MRI) should be made depending on the initial tumor location and the initial tumor or N category in accordance with the recommendations in the chapter on primary diagnostics. If these examinations indicate a suspicion of locoregional recurrence or residue, distant metastasis or a second tumor, FDG-PET/CT may be considered. There is no evidence that regular chest X-rays or the determination of tumor markers in serum are of any benefit in tumor follow-up. In March 2017, the Federal Joint Committee decided in accordance with Section 91 of the Social Security Code (SGB V) that PET/CT for head and neck tumors will be covered by health insurance to avoid invasive procedures such as neck dissection and laryngoscopic biopsy. This applies in particular to patients with laryngeal cancer after primary radiochemotherapy. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","8.3. Value of control microlaryngoscopy 121 8.3. Value of control microlaryngoscopy 8.6. Evidence-based recommendation Recommendation level In case of delayed healing or clinical suspicion of recurrence during laryngoscopy or videolaryngostroboscopy in the case of partial laryngeal resection, microlaryngoscopy should be performed. B Microlaryngoscopy should also be performed: a) if suspicious findings in the form of granulations, erosions, keratoses and dysplasias do not disappear or increase in size after initial reduction, or b) with narrow resection margins in the anterior commissure. Level of Evidence [419-421] 2b Strong consensus: 100% In case of delayed healing with clinical suspicion of recurrence in videolaryngostroboscopy, a control microlaryngoscopy is indicated for endolaryngeal resected carcinomas by cordectomy type I to VI according to ELS criteria [422, 423]. Repeated resections for T1 and T2 carcinoma can be performed like the initial operation with the CO2 laser [419, 424]. Suspicion arises when suspicious findings in the form of granulations, erosions, keratoses and dysplasia do not disappear or increase in size after an initial reduction [425, 426]. An anterior synechia with severe hoarseness or aphonia can be considered suspicious even in the case of a smooth, scarred epithelial surface. The outcome of repeated resections with the CO2 laser for T1 and T2 carcinoma is assessed in the same way as in the initial operation with marginal incisions or marginal assessment [420, 424, 427]. If carcinoma is found repeatedly in the reoperations, the survival rate drops significantly [419]. In T1 carcinomas treated primarily with laser microsurgery, organ preservation is over 97%, even if up to three recurrences occur. Survival or laryngeal preservation does not depend on the timing of the recurrence, e.g. in the first three years, nor on the extent of the tumor within the T1 category, the depth of infiltration, involvement of the vocal process or the need for further surgical measures [421]. In the case of delayed healing with clinical suspicion of recurrence in videolaryngostroboscopy, a control microlaryngoscopy is indicated for endolaryngeal resected carcinomas by cordectomy type I to VI according to ELS criteria. The control microlaryngoscopy should be performed if suspicious findings in the form of granulations, erosions, keratoses and dysplasias do not disappear or if they enlarge again after an initial reduction. In cases of anterior synechia with severe hoarseness or aphonia, a control microlaryngoscopy is advisable even in the case of a smooth, scarred epithelial surface. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","8.4. Molecular diagnostics in follow-up care 122 8.4. Molecular diagnostics in follow-up care 8.7. Consensus-based statement EEC There are no established tumor markers for molecular diagnostics in the follow-up of patients with laryngeal carcinoma. Consensus: 95% Currently, there are no established tumor markers for molecular diagnostics in the follow-up of patients with laryngeal carcinoma that have been validated by sufficiently large retrospective and prospective studies. Approaches for noninvasive molecular diagnostics in relation to treatment response and early detection of tumor progression currently focus on the analysis of cell-free tumor DNA in saliva or blood samples [428]. The detection of tumor DNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker for numerous tumor entities, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and is often independent of the detection of circulating tumor cells in the blood [429]. The potential of detecting tumor DNA in saliva and blood samples was tested in a study with 93 HNSCC patients (of which n=10 had laryngeal carcinoma) [428]. Tumor DNA was defined by the detection of viral DNA (HPV16 and HPV18) or frequently occurring somatic mutations in HNSCC. Tumor DNA was detected in 76% of saliva samples and 87% of blood samples. In a subgroup for which both saliva and blood samples were available, the proportion of patients with positive tumor DNA findings was 96%. With regard to molecular diagnostics in follow-up care, saliva and blood samples were taken from nine patients after tumor resection and tested for tumor DNA as part of the study. Tumor DNA was detected in three patients (including one patient with laryngeal carcinoma) several months before a clinical finding of tumor progression. In contrast, no tumor DNA was detected in saliva or blood samples in patients without tumor progression. In another study on resistance mechanisms during treatment with cetuximab, tumor DNA from blood samples of 20 HNSCC patients (mainly from the oral cavity and oropharynx) was examined [430]. The data show an enrichment of activating RAS mutations in patients with progression during the course of therapy. In half of the patients, RAS mutations were already detected before the diagnosis of clinical progression. An alternative for molecular diagnostics in the follow-up of laryngeal carcinoma is the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood samples. The detection of CTCs during or after treatment can indicate a high risk of treatment failure and tumor progression. A meta-analysis of published studies on HNSCC shows that the detection of CTCs in the blood has a high specificity but only a low sensitivity as a diagnostic biomarker and is associated with poor progression-free and overall survival [431]. In a prospective study, CTCs in blood samples from 53 HNSCC patients (including 15 with laryngeal carcinoma) with local recurrence or distant metastasis were examined before and after systemic therapy [432]. CTCs could be detected in 30% of the patients and were significantly correlated with the prognosis and treatment efficacy. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","8.5. Social legal and psychosocial counselling 123 The extent to which the detection of tumor DNA or CTCs in blood samples can complement conventional imaging procedures in the follow-up of laryngeal carcinoma must be validated through more extensive, prospective studies and cannot yet be conclusively assessed based on the current data. 8.5. Social legal and psychosocial counseling 8.8. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Sociolegal and psychosocial counseling should be part of the long-term care of patients with laryngeal cancer. Strong consensus: 100% In recent years, the risk of ending up in a precarious financial situation due to cancer has increased significantly. On the one hand, expenses increase and on the other hand, income often decreases considerably due to the receipt of sick pay or disability pension. Illness as a cause of excessive indebtedness is now a well-known problem. For this reason, an important goal of social and social legal advice is to secure material and economic existence as well as participation in working life and to enable access to social welfare benefits. The following advice services are therefore part of social and social legal advice: • Comprehensive information on social law (health, pension, nursing care insurance, severely disabled person’s card) • Assistance with completing applications and submitting applications • Advice on ways to keep your job, initiation of professional reintegration, initiation of professional rehabilitation measures • Psychosocial counseling for coping with illness, in conflict situations, for participation in social life • Information about advice centres (integration services, addiction and debt advice, pension insurance service centres) In order to ensure psychosocial and social legal counselling, it is important that patients with laryngeal carcinoma receive initial oncological counselling in the inpatient context from the social services of the acute hospitals and Rehabilitation facilities are provided. This is the only way to ensure that those affected and their families receive basic psychosocial information and that initial, rapid interventions are possible if necessary. Outpatient cancer counseling centers offer low-threshold psychosocial counseling services for the phase after inpatient treatment on psychological, social and socio-legal stressors and provide information on Self-help groups and other counseling services. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","9. Supply structures 124 9. Supply structures 9.1. Consensus-based recommendation EEC Interdisciplinary care and networking of all specialties and disciplines involved in care should be ensured. Strong consensus: 100% The patient should receive the best possible care in accordance with the current state of medical knowledge. In order to achieve the best possible result in terms of functional preservation, quality of life and life expectancy in accordance with what is medically possible, the cooperation of different experts is necessary. This requires that the patient is cared for by highly qualified centers in which he can be fully informed about the possibilities of laryngeal surgery, radiotherapy and internal oncology and in which or under whose coordination the selected therapy and rehabilitation can be implemented. However, there is also an understandable need for patients to be cared for by familiar doctors in their local area, even with this serious illness. Involving primary care ENT doctors and family doctors in the care process according to the respective phase of the illness is therefore essential for optimal care. The patient's wish for optimal care can only be fulfilled by networking all structures involved in the care of the patient. This begins with the rapid use of targeted diagnostics when the disease is suspected and, if laryngeal carcinoma is confirmed, continues with information about treatment strategies, with the choice and implementation of therapy, and up to rehabilitation and aftercare, including preparation for life after treatment of the disease. All professional groups involved in the care of the patient should work together within the framework of network structures through which the patient is guided in order to receive the appropriate care according to his or her respective phase of the disease. These network structures vary from region to region and the availability of outpatient centers Specialist medical care is not always available locally, so coordination of patient care by the primary treating clinic is very important. Patient self-help groups should also be included. The networking of the various care structures requires comprehensive and rapid information transfer between all those involved about all care-related circumstances. Loss of information during the transfer from one care area to another can thus be avoided. © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","10. Quality indicators 125 10. Quality indicators Quality indicators (QI) are measurement variables that are used to assess the quality of the underlying structures, processes or results [433]. Quality indicators are an important instrument of quality management. The aim of their use is to continuously improve care by presenting the results of care, critically reflecting on them and, if necessary, improving them. The present selection of quality indicators was created according to the methodology of the oncology guideline program [434]. The basis for the creation of the quality indicators were all strong recommendations (strength of recommendation A, “should”) of the guideline, as well as a search for existing national and international QIs. A working group “AG Quality Indicators” was formed for the process. The exact procedure is set out in the guideline report. After a face-to-face meeting and a telephone conference of this working group, six indicators were adopted (seeTable 9 ). In addition to the derived QIs, the QI working group has identified the time between surgery and the end of radiotherapy as an area with potential for improvement. Since the underlying recommendation (No. 69) cannot be used as a \"should\" recommendation according to the methodology of the guideline program for the derivation of the QIs, the QI working group suggests that 1. An evaluation should be carried out using the cancer registers, in which the period from surgery to the end of radiotherapy is presented, if possible nationwide. 2. a corresponding key figure is submitted to the certification committee of the KHT centres: counter: Number of patients who completed radiotherapy within 77 days after surgery denominator: All patients with initial diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma and postoperative radiotherapy © Oncology Guideline Program | S3 Guideline Laryngeal Carcinoma | Long Version 1.0 | January 2019 ","10.
