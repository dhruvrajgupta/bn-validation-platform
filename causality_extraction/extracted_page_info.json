        "summary": "This page details the AJCC TNM staging system for laryngeal cancers (8th edition, 2017). It categorizes the primary tumor (T) stages for different regions of the larynx: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. Each section describes the progression of tumor invasion, from limited local spread to advanced disease involving surrounding tissues and structures. T1 represents localized tumors, while T4 is divided into T4a for moderately advanced and T4b for very advanced disease, indicating extensive invasion into critical areas such as the thyroid cartilage, prevertebral space, or carotid artery encasement. Non-epithelial tumors are excluded from this staging system.",
