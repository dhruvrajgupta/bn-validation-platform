    "TX of Primary Tumor means Primary tumor cannot be assessed. Tis of Primary Tumor means Carcinoma in situ.",

    "T1 of the Supraglottis means Tumor limited to one subsite of the supraglottis with normal vocal cord mobility. T2 of the Supraglottis means Tumor invades the mucosa of more than one adjacent subsite of the supraglottis or glottis, or a region outside the supraglottis (e.g., mucosa of the base of the tongue, vallecula, medial wall of the pyriform sinus), without fixation of the larynx. T3 of the Supraglottis means Tumor limited to the larynx with vocal cord fixation and/or invades any of the following: postcricoid area, preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, and/or inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage. T4 of the Supraglottis includes: T4a of the T4 of the Supraglottis means Moderately advanced local disease. Tumor invades through the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of the neck including deep extrinsic muscle of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus). T4b of the T4 of the Supraglottis means Very advanced local disease. Tumor invades the prevertebral space, encases the carotid artery, or invades mediastinal structures.",

    "T1 of the Glottis means Tumor limited to the vocal cord(s) (may involve the anterior or posterior commissure) with normal mobility. T1a of the T1 of the Glottis means Tumor limited to one vocal cord. T1b of the T1 of the Glottis means Tumor involves both vocal cords. T2 of the Glottis means Tumor extends to the supraglottis and/or subglottis, and/or there is impaired vocal cord mobility. T3 of the Glottis means Tumor limited to the larynx with vocal cord fixation and/or invasion of the paraglottic space and/or inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage. T4 of the Glottis includes: T4a of the T4 of the Glottis means Moderately advanced local disease. Tumor invades through the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, cricoid cartilage, soft tissues of the neck including deep extrinsic muscles of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus). T4b of the T4 of the Glottis means Very advanced local disease. Tumor invades the prevertebral space, encases the carotid artery, or invades mediastinal structures.",

    "T1 of the Subglottis means Tumor limited to the subglottis. T2 of the Subglottis means Tumor extends to the vocal cord(s) with normal or impaired mobility. T3 of the Subglottis means Tumor limited to the larynx with vocal cord fixation and/or invasion of the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage. T4 of the Subglottis includes: T4a of the T4 of the Subglottis means Moderately advanced local disease. Tumor invades the cricoid or thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of the neck including deep extrinsic muscles of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus). T4b of the T4 of the Subglottis means Very advanced local disease. Tumor invades the prevertebral space, encases the carotid artery, or invades mediastinal structures."
